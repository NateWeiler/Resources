# Web Video Editor

I got tired of eyeballing FFmpeg commands, so here's a quick & dirty web-based interface.

Load a video, adjust the time, and click+drag on the screen to crop into a rectangle.

The web page (optionally) supports loading a Javascript-compiled version of FFmpeg, 
which can encode small jobs within the browser.
