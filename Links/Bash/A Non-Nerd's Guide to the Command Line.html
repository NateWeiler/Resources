    <h3>A Non-Nerd's Guide To</h3>
    <h1>The Command Line</h1>
    <img alt='' src='http://blog.marc-seeger.de/assets/2009/12/30/terminal.png'>
    <p>To jump right in and start using it, go that way. →
    <br />
    ↓ Or go this way to get some context.</p>
    
    <p><small>Using <code>→</code>, <code>↓</code>, &amp; <code>space</code> on your keyboard works the best.</small></p>

    <h2>1969</h2>
    <p>The year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> was invented. It's still one of the most-used
    operating systems in the world (just think: all of Google's servers use
    it).  Mac OSX and Linux are based on it. When you use the command line,
    you're using your computer the way people used computers decades before
    colorful screens and the mouse were in use.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Shell</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~buja/STAT-540/shell-Bourne-An-Introduction-to-the-Unix-Shell.htm">Bourne Shell</a> (abbreviated as simply <em>sh</em>) was created as a way
    to interact with Unix in 1977.  Lots of other shells were invented later
    that added more features.  You may have noticed that your Terminal says
    something about "bash"&mdash; bash is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bourne-again shell</a> and
    was first created in 1989. A lot of cool kids these days use <a href="https://friedcpu.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/zsh-the-last-shell-youll-ever-need/">zsh</a>
    (z shell), if you care about what the cool kids do.</p>

    <h2>So what?</h2>
    <p>So why do people still use it?</p>
    
    <p>Because it's <em>easy</em>.</p>
    
    <p>That is, it's hard to write programs that use graphics. Writing programs
    that run in a shell, though, is easy peasy. So, there are all kinds
    of things that you can only do using shell.</p>
    
    <p>Getting started in it is a bit strange, admittedly, but it opens up whole
    new worlds (it <em>is</em> a whole new world). Don't get overwhelmed, just take
    it slow. Any familiarity will be great, so if it starts feeling
    overwhelming, just stop for the day.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>On a Mac</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hit Command &amp; Space and type "Terminal". Open it. This is your "command
    line".</li>
      <li>Open up Finder (you can do the Command-Space thing again) and find your
    home directory (it's the one in the sidebar with a house icon, and it's
    probably named after you).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>On Linux</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open your terminal</li>
      <li>Open your file browser and navigate to your home folder</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>On Windows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open up <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">Git-Bash</a>. This is your "command line".</li>
      <li>
        <p>Open your My Documents folder (or whatever it's called these days).</p>
    
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Listing</h2>
    <p>The command line is a very simple way of interacting with a computer (simple
    for the computer, anyhow!). You just type a command and then hit
    <code>enter</code>/<code>return</code> on your keyboard.</p>
    
    <p><small>This obviously requires a bit of memorization. But
    the internet is there when we forget.</small></p>
    
    <p>One thing people need to do all the time is list files. &darr; This way
    to try it now! &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Type what comes after the dollar sign into your command line, and then
    hit <code>enter</code>:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ ls&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Compare it to what you see in Finder/Explorer. It's an old-school way of
    listing files!</p>
    
    <p>&darr; That way to learn more about listing.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Long Listing</h3>
    <p>Press <code>↑</code> on your keyboard. Now that you got your <code>ls</code> back, turn it
    into this &amp; hit <code>enter</code>:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ ls -l&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>The <code>-l</code> is called a "flag". You added a <code>-l</code> flag to the <code>ls</code> command,
    which tells <code>ls</code> to "long list" your files. This gives you all sorts of
    info about your files, like who owns them, what you can do with them,
    and the file size. Here's <a href="http://freeengineer.org/learnUNIXin10minutes.html#Listing">what it all means</a>, if
    you're curious (and brave).</p>
    
    <p>One more thing about listing, right this way. ↓</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Listing Hidden Files</h3>
    <p>All this time using your computer, and you never even knew it was hiding
    all sorts of things from you! Enter this:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ ls -al&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Now you've added <em>two</em> flags for <code>ls</code>. The <code>l</code> tells it to list "long",
    the <code>a</code> tells it to list "all". Not just the usual stuff, but all the
    stuff that's usually hidden from you, too!</p>
    
    <p>Hidden files start with a dot. They're often called "dotfiles". Notice
    the two "files" listed at the top, the single dot and the double dot.
    These aren't actual files. You'll learn more about them soon. &rarr;</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Moving Around</h2>
    <p>In the days when the command line was created, folders were called
    <em>directories</em>. So to <strong><em>c</em></strong>hange
    <strong><em>d</em></strong>irectories, try this:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ cd Desktop&#x000A;$ ls&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Now you're looking at your desktop on the command line. You
    <strong><em>c</em></strong>hanged into the
    <strong><em>d</em></strong>irectory called
    Desktop.</p>
    
    <p>&darr; This way to keep from getting lost.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Where Are You?</h3>
    <p>In case you forget what directory you're currently working in, you
    can ask to be told:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ pwd&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>This means Print Working Directory; it prints the directory you're
    working in <em>to the screen</em>. (When this command was invented, screens
    didn't exist, so it would have actually printed it!)</p>
    
    <p>To get back to where you just came from, you could write <code>cd</code> followed
    by everything <code>pwd</code> showed you, minus the <code>/Desktop</code>. But there's
    an easier way. &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Back In With Your Parent</h3>
    <p>To get into the <em>parent</em> directory, do this</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ cd ..&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>So that <code>..</code> that you see when you <code>ls -a</code> is a link to a directory. A
    link to the parent directory of the one you're in. If this all feels
    really weird, try just <code>cd</code>ing into different folders and <code>cd ..</code>ing back
    out for a while, hitting <code>pwd</code> to see where you are in between.</p>
    
    <p><code>..</code> isn't the only shortcut, though. &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Be Lazy</h3>
    <p>Good coders are lazy. They do work up front to prevent long-term work.
    Here are some tricks to avoid typing:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>.</code> means "the directory you're in now". <code>ls .</code> = <code>ls</code>; <code>cd .</code> does nothing.
    But <code>.</code> is useful sometimes.</li>
      <li><code>~</code> (tilde) means "your home directory". You can <code>cd</code> into really obscure
    folders and easily <code>ls ~</code> or <code>cd ~</code>.</li>
      <li><code>cd</code> without anything after it (without any <em>arguments</em>) does the same
    thing as <code>cd ~</code>. It takes you home.</li>
      <li><code>*</code> (often called <em>splat</em> because "asterisk" is <em>too long</em>) is a
    wildcard; try <code>ls ~/D*</code> &amp; <code>ls ~/*s</code>.</li>
      <li><code>cd -</code> takes you back to the previous directory, so you can switch back &amp;
    forth between two easily.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>A New Name, A Move, A Copy</h2>
    <p>Renaming a file is the same thing as moving it. You "move" it from
    one place/name to another. Let's create a file:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ touch tmp.txt&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p><small>(<code>touch</code> will create a file if it doesn't exist, or re-save a file that's
    already there.)</small></p>
    
    <p>move it:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ mv tmp.txt ~/Desktop&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>and then rename it:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ cd ~/Desktop&#x000A;$ mv tmp.txt woohoo.txt&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>To learn to make copies, this way. &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Copy Cat</h3>
    <p>Let's make two of something.</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ touch woohoo.txt&#x000A;$ cp woohoo.txt amazing.txt&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p><code>cp</code> makes copies. You just tell it the file to copy, and then the new place
    and name to put it/name it.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Pro Tip: <code>&&</code></h3>
    <p>Run two commands at once with <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. To make a copy and then list all
    files (to verify it actually copied), you can do this:</p>
    
    <pre><code>cp amazing.txt fabulous.txt &amp;&amp; ls&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Make sure you use <em>two</em> "&amp;"s, though; using only one does something
    <em>veeery</em> different!  You'll be very confused if you only use one!</p>
    
    <p><small>Using only one <code>&amp;</code> starts something in the background. Search online
    to find out more about it.</small></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Reading Files</h2>
    <p>Listing files is cool &amp; all, but what if you want to see what's in them?
    There are lots of ways to do this. Some of the most common are <code>cat</code>
    (which con<em>cat</em>enates files), <code>more</code>, and <code>less</code>.</p>
    
    <p>You'll need a file to read! Download <a href="/this-is-water">this file</a> into your current
    working directory. Right-click the link (or control-click, or two-finger
    click) and select "save link as". If you can't remember where
    you should save it to, use <a href="#/3/1">pwd</a> to remind yourself.</p>
    
    <p>Now let's read it! &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Try three ways of reading it. Try these one at a time:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ cat this-is-water&#x000A;$ more this-is-water&#x000A;$ less this-is-water&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Oh no! Now your whole terminal window has been taken over by <code>less</code>! And
    the scrolling's all weird! What to do? &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>More with Less</h3>
    <p>So <code>cat</code> and <code>more</code> just plopped the contents of the file into <em>standard
    output</em>, but <code>less</code> took things over &amp; messed up your scrolling. To get
    out of it, hit <code>q</code>. Phew!</p>
    
    <p>Ok, but let's try it again, with a bigger file. Download <a href="/my-father-moved-through-dooms-of-love">this</a>
    to your current working directory and then type</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ less my-father&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p><small>At this point I <em>must</em> pause and tell you to hit <em>Tab</em> on your
    keyboard. Ta-da! Stop typing so much.</small></p>
    
    <p>Now open it up with <code>less</code> again, and let's learn how to scroll. &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Less &amp; More Scrolling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scroll by one line: <code>j</code> and <code>k</code></li>
      <li>Scroll half pages: <code>d</code> and <code>u</code></li>
      <li>Scroll whole pages: <code>space</code> and <code>b</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><code>space</code> and <code>b</code> scroll a page at a time. <code>d</code> and <code>u</code> scroll half a page.
    <code>e</code> and <code>y</code>, line by line.</p>
    
    <p>Now try reading the file with <code>more</code>. You can use all of these same
    scrolling commands. Lots of programs use them.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Delete, Delete.</h2>
    <p>The command line has no safety nets! When you delete things, they're gone
    for good. No steenkin' <em>trash</em>, no steenkin' <em>recycle bin</em>. Just <em>gone</em>.
    So be careful!</p>
    
    <p>But to get rid of the files you just downloaded, you can</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ rm my-father-moved-through-dooms-of-love this-is-water&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Note that you just passed <code>rm</code> <em>two</em> files to delete. You can list
    however many you want.</p>
    
    <p>But to <code>rm</code> whole folders, you'll need a different trick. &darr;</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Removing Whole Directories</h3>
    <p>If you try to <code>rm</code> a directory, <code>rm</code> will get all whiny and say it can't.
    But you can make it do it anyway by passing it the <code>-r</code> flag.  (The <code>-r</code>
    stands for <em>recursive</em>, because if you're peculiar you might say that
    you're deleting the folder and then <em>recursively</em> deleting everything in
    it. Maybe?? Anyhow.) Try it out! Make a directory then delete it:</p>
    
    <pre><code>$ mkdir worthless-folder&#x000A;$ rm worthless-folder&#x000A;$ rm -r worthless-folder&#x000A;</code></pre>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
  <p>You're now significantly more hireable! That's really all it takes. You're
  on your way to tapping into the unbridled power of the shell.</p>
  
  <p>These were the basics. Play with what you learned! Have fun! Come back here
  when you forget things.</p>
  
  <p>When you're ready, you can learn how the pros do it with the <a href="/fledgling/">fledgling
  nerd's guide to the command line</a>.</p>
