VERSION HISTORY
================================================================================
1.4.0.0
+ Added multiline surroundwith functionality
+ Dockable window now shows both Snippets and SurroundWith at the same time. (users wished it).
To save space, Reload button functionality is now moved to context menu. Right click Listbox and click Reload (on both Listboxes)

- Fixed indentation
- Endline character is now based on the Notepad++ mode and not on the OS
- General will always be enabled no matter if set to true or false.
- General will be created on start if does not already exist
- Documentation converted to HTML for better readability (hopefully)
- This version recreated from scratch. Let me know asap if anything working differently.
- Only one DLL is needed from this version.
- From now on my primary email address is: (rajesh dot madhra @ gmail dot com) 

1.3.0.0
+ Added rename functionality for snippets.
+ Added functionality to Add, Delete, Rename languages
- Data is now kept filtered after deleting an item or changing language.
- Fixed a minor bug.
  When Notepad++ started, a message box was shown telling:
  "SurroundWith LoadData: Value cannot be null. Parameter name: value".
- Fixed a bug.
  (SnippetPlus.xml was opened, edited manually and saved in Notepad++. Reload was not pressed and Notepad++ was closed. The edited data was lost when you reopened the SnippetPlus.xml. It was due to a bug that saved the file from memory to save "Use Surround With" status on Notepad++ exit. It started from version 1.2 when I introduced the options functionality)


1.2.0.0
+ If current document language has no SurroundWith, then popup list will show SurroundWith from GENERAL language.
+ Added option to remember the status of "Use Surround With" checkbox.
+ Added option MaxItemsInAutoComplete. Now you decide how many items to see in popup list. Default is 5.
- Fixed a reload bug. (New item was shown in the list but double click did not enter the text into Notepad++)
- After inserting text, Notepad++ now gets focus

--> Command name changed
From: Plugins -> SnippetPlus -> SurroundWith 
To:   Plugins -> SnippetPlus -> Insert SurroundWith
so please change your contextMenu.xml if you are using right click.

=> Tested only with Notepad++ version 5.7 on only Win7(64) as I do not have other OS to test on. But should work on other platforms.
If something wrong, kindly let me know.



1.1.0.0
- SurroundWith is fully functional and now you can have as many of them as you want.
- Rearranged internal structure due to performance reasons, so let me know if anything behave differently.
