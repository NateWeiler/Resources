# Flaskr Express

Rebuilding the [Flask tutorial project](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/) in [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to compare how simple CRUD apps are built with different languages and frameworks.


## Running the App

First, clone this repo and install the dependencies. You will need a current version of Node and npm.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:zachfedor/flaskr-express.git
$ cd flaskr-express
$ npm install
```

To get the server running, you can use the `npm start` command and then visit the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

If you are working on the app, you can use the `npm run dev` command to restart the server automatically on file changes.


## To-Do

Search the code base for `TODO` comments if you'd like to contribute to these open items:

- [X] Build auth and blog routes and views
- [ ] Add test runner and write tests
- [ ] Add SQLite database adapter
- [ ] Update auth with hashed passwords and sessions using signed cookies
