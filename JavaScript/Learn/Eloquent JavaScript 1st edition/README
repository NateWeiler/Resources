This is the source from which I build http://eloquentjavascript.net

To build it yourself, install GHC (with the parsec2, mtl, and
utf8-string libraries), and run `make.sh` in the `renderer/` dir. You
should get a `render` binary, which you can run on a text file to
produce the HTML for the book.

The file `book` contains the source for the actual book. Its format is
completely undocumented, but relatively straightforward.
