* Overview 

[[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt][Nyxt]] is a  web-browser written in Common Lisp atop Webkit.
Nextalk aims to speech-enable nyxt 
: emacs::emacspeak <->  Next::Nextalk.

* Building Nyxt

Note: Some of these steps below are taken care of by Nyxt as of
version 2.0.


On my Debian box, I needed to:

  1. Update my installation of quicklisp 
    :  (ql:update-dist "quicklisp")
  2. Install _cl-webkit_ under _quicklisp/local_ from  https://github.com/next-browser/cl-webkit 
  3. with the above, the browser builds and runs cleanly under SBCL.
  4. Create a symlink in _quicklisp/local_ to the _tts_ directory
     found here.
  5. Symlink _.config/nyxt/init.lisp_ to the _init.lisp_ found here.

* Component Overview 

  - init.lisp :: My  _~/.config/nyxt/init.lisp_ file.
  - tts :: TTS module connecting CL to Emacspeak TTS servers. 

* AWeb: Audio Web

Implement a speech-extension to nyxt.
