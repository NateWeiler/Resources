;;{{{  Introduction:
;;; Commentary:
;;; This module speech enables ispell.
;;; Implementation note: This is hard because of how  ispell.el is written
;;; Namely, all of the work is done by one huge hairy function.
;;; This makes advising it hard.
;;; The ispell commands work well with Emacspeak as long as the list of correction choices are few.
;;; For interactively moving through corrections, install package flyspell-correct from MELPA
;;; (package-install "flyspell-correct")
;;; Then use M-x flyspell-mode.
;;; Package flyspell is speech-enabled by Emacspeak module emacspeak-flyspell
;;; And that module sets up flyspell-correct to use IDO-style completion,
;;; i.e. you can move through corrections with C-r and C-s.
