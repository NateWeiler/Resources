;;; Commentary:
;;{{{  Introduction:
;;; This module makes eterm talk.
;;; Eterm is the new terminal emulator for Emacs.
;;; Use of emacspeak with eterm really needs an info page.
;;; At present, the only documentation is the source level documentation.
;;; This module uses Control-t as an additional prefix key to allow the user
;;; To move around the terminal and have different parts spoken.
