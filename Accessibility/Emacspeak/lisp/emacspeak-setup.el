;;{{{ Introduction

;;; Commentary:
;;; Entry point for Emacspeak.
;;; The simplest and most basic way to start emacspeak is:
;;; emacs -q -l <emacspeak-dir>/lisp/emacspeak-setup.el
;;; The above starts a vanilla Emacs with just Emacspeak loaded.
;;; Once the above has been verified to work,
;;; You can  add
;;; (load-library "emacspeak-setup")
;;; To your .emacs file.
;;; See tvr/emacs-startup.el in the Emacspeak Git repository for  my setup.
