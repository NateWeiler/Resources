;;; Commentary:
;;; NOV == Yet Another EPub Reader 
;;; Package nov.el is an alternative to Emacspeak's built-in EPub
;;; reader.
;;; This module speech-enables nov.el
;;; In addition, opening an epub using nov results in
;;; directory-specific settings being loaded from file
;;; @var{emacspeak-speak-directory-settings} ---
;;;  That file can set book-specific settings such as speech-rate and
;;; punctuation-mode among others.

;;; Code:
