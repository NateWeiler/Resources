;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:
;;; VDIFF ==  vimdiff
;;; Installable from melpa, vdiff enables synchronized movement
;;; through diff buffers without resorting to an extra control-panel
;;; as is the case with ediff.
;;;  In addition to speech-enabling interactive commands and setting
;;;  up face->voice mappings, this module provides commands that speak
;;;  the current hunk. These are bound in @code{vdiff-mode-prefix-map}.
;;; @itemize  @bullet
;;; @item  @code{emacspeak-vdiff-speak-this-hunk} bound to @kbd{SPC}.
;;; @item @code{emacspeak-vdiff-speak-other-hunk} bound to @kbd{C-SPC}.
;;; @item @code{emacspeak-vdiff-speak-other-line} bound to @kbd{l}.
