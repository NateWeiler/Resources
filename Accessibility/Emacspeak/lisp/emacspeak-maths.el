;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:
;;; @subsection Setup 
;;; Do not try what follows until you have read  js/node/README.org
;;; and successfully set up nvm (Node Version Manager) as described there.
;;; @subsection Technical Overview 
;;; Spoken mathematics on the emacspeak audio desktop. Use a NodeJS
;;; based speech-rule-engine for Mathematics as the backend for
;;; processing mathematical markup. The result of this processing is
;;; an annotated S-expression that is rendered via Emacspeak's speech
;;; facilities. Annotations follow Aural CSS as implemented in
;;; Emacspeak, This allows us to map these expressions to aural
;;; properties supported by specific TTS engines. 
;;; @subsection Basic Usage: 
;;;
;;; Start  the server/client: M-x emacspeak-maths-start. Once the server
;;; and client are started, you can browse any number of math
;;; expressions using the emacspeak-maths-navigator described below.
;;; Note: In general, once everything is configured correctly, using
;;; the maths navigator automatically starts the server and
;;; client. Invoke the Navigator using s-spc --- this is the <windows>
;;; key on
;;; Linux. Now you can use these keys:
;;; @itemize
;;; @item  Show Output <o> Switch to output buffer and quit Maths Navigator
;;; @item Enter: <SPC>
;;; Enter a LaTeX expression.
;;; @item Smart-Enter: <enter> Enter the guessed expression with no prompting.
;;; @item Alt-Text <a> Process alt-text
;;; under point as LaTeX.
;;; @item Down <down> Move down a level.
;;; @item
;;; Up <up> Move up a level.
;;; @item Left <left> Move left.
;;; @item Right
;;; <right> Move right.
;;; @item Exit <any other key> Exit
;;; navigator.
;;;
;;;
;;; @end itemize
;;;The current expression is spoken after
;;; each of the above commands. It is also displayed in a special
;;; buffer *Spoken Math*. That buffer holds all previously generated
;;; output, And Emacs commands forward-page and backward-page can be
;;; used to move through each chunk of output.

;;; Code:
