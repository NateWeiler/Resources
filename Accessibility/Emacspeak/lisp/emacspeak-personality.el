;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:
;;; Implementation Notes From 2018:

;;; After 3 years, variable emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces has
;;; been removed,
;;; and the advice on put-text-property and friends removed.
;;; This module nowlimits itself to mapping face/font-lock properties
;;; from overlays to the associated text-property (personality).
;;; This mapping is done via emacspeak-personality-add.
;;; The options for cumulative personalities have been removed.

;;; Implementation Notes From 2015:

;;; Setting emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces to
;;; nil  now results in dtk-speak falling back to the
;;; face->voice mapping defined via voice-setup for the face at
;;; point. What this means:
;;;
;;; 1. You always get voice-locking except
;;; when you set voice-lock-mode to nil.
;;;
;;; 2. The advice on
;;; put-text-property and friends become a no-op and we still get
;;; voice-locking.
;;;
;;; 3. Eventually this will become the default behavior
;;; for voice-locking.

;;; Implementation Notes from 2002.

;;; This module defines a personality interface for implementing voice
;;; lock via font lock.
;;; Context:

;;; At the time I implemented Emacspeak's voice lock feature in late
;;; 1994, font-lock was still evolving. Most packages that supported
;;; The font-lock module explicitly checked for windowing system and
;;; became active only when Emacs was running under a windowing
;;; system.
;;; Since I wanted emacspeak  to work both within and outside X, and I
;;; did not want to change any of Emacs' code, I implemented
;;; voice-lock  as a separate module.
;;; This also kept things stable as font-lock itself evolved and
;;; changed.

;;; 8 years later, font-lock is now stable.
;;; It is also active outside windowing systems, since Emacs can now
;;; colorize terminals.
;;; This module when complete will simplify the voice-lock code in
;;; Emacspeak by triggering voice locking directly from within the
;;; font-lock code.

;;; Emacspeak modules will still be able to voice lock independent of
;;; visual characteristics --this was a key goal of the original
;;; Emacspeak design and it will be preserved going forward.

;;; Finally, I am adding  better support for overlays --again this was a
;;; part of Emacs that was at its nascent stage in 1994, but is now
;;; stable.

;;; Code:
