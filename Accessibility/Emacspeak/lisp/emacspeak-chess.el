;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; The Emacs Chess package provides a rich environment for playing and
;;; exploring Chess Games.
;;; That package comes with a light-weight module that announces
;;; moves.
;;;
;;; This module aims do do much more, including:
;;; @itemize @bullet
;;; @item Navigate the board along various axies with audio-formatted  output.
;;;  @item Browse games via  rich audio-formatted   output.
;;; @item Speech-enable all interactive commands  provided by the Chess
;;; package.
;;; @item Enable various means of exploring the state of game, perhaps with
;;; a view to being able to spot patterns   from listening to the
;;; output.
;;; @end itemize
;;; @subsection Navigating And Examining The Board
;;; The board can be navigated along the 8 compass directions.
;;; Arrow keys move to the appropriate squares on the board.
;;; @kbd{/} and @kbd{\} move down the diagonals.
;;; @kbd{[} and @kbd{]} move up the respective diagonals.
;;; @itemize  @bullet
;;; @item  Move North: @code{emacspeak-chess-north} bound to @kbd{up}.
;;; @item  Move South: @code{emacspeak-chess-south} bound to
;;; @kbd{down}.
;;; @item  Move West: @code{emacspeak-chess-west} bound to @kbd{left}.
;;; @item  Move East: @code{emacspeak-chess-east} bound to @kbd{right}.
;;; @end itemize
;;; You can also move along the diagonals:
;;; @itemize @bullet
;;; @item  Move Northwest: @code{emacspeak-chess-northwest} bound to
;;; @kbd{[}.
;;; @item  Move Northeast: @code{emacspeak-chess-northeast} bound to  @kbd{]}.
;;; @item  Move Southwest: @code{emacspeak-chess-southwest} bound to
;;; @kbd{/}.
;;; @item  Move Southeast: @code{emacspeak-chess-southeast} bound to
;;; @kbd{\}.
;;; @end itemize
;;; You can also jump to a given board position by:
;;; @itemize @bullet
;;; @item  Jump: @code{emacspeak-chess-jump} bound to @kbd{j}.
;;; @item Target of last move: @code{emacspeak-chess-goto-target} bound to @kbd{t}.
;;; @item Look: @code{emacspeak-chess-speak-that-square} bound to
;;;@kbd{l}.
;;; @item  Review   current square: @kbd{;}.
;;; @item Review Board: @code{emacspeak-chess-speak-board} bound to
;;;@kbd{z}. Useful in end-state.
;;; @item Locate pieces: @code{emacspeak-chess-speak-piece-squares}
;;;bound to @kbd{s}. Specify piece as a single char --- @kbd{w} speaks
;;;all white pieces, @kbd{l} speaks all black pieces, use SAN notation
;;; char for a specific piece.  Use @kbd{a} to hear entire board, this
;;;last is most useful when the game is an end-state.
;;; @item Discover who targets a square:
;;;@code{emacspeak-chess-speak-who-targets} bound to @kbd{w}. Argument
;;;@code{piece} is similar to the previously listed command.
;;; @end itemize
;;; You can obtain views of the board along the rows and diagonals, as
;;;well as a @emph{knight's perspective }:
;;; @itemize @bullet
;;; @item Viewers: @kbd{v} followed by the directional navigation keys
;;;speaks the squares in that direction from the current
;;;square. @kbd{vn} speaks the squares from a knight's perspective,
;;;i.e. the squares the Knight would see  from the current
;;;position. similarly, @kbd{vk} speaks the non-empty squares seen by the King
;;;from the current position.
;;; @kbd{v} followed by a rank-or-file char speaks that complete rank
;;;or file.
;;; @end itemize
;;; @subsection Examining Games

;;; Package @emph{Chess} allows one to browse through a game using
;;;@kbd{,} and @kbd{.}  --- @code{chess-display-move-backward} and
;;;@code{chess-display-move-forward}.  Emacspeak speech-enables these
;;;commands to speak the move that led to the currently displayed
;;;state of the game. Finally, @kbd{m} speaks the @emph{current move}
;;;being displayed.

;;; Code:
