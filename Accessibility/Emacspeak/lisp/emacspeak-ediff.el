;;{{{ Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;;Ediff provides a nice visual interface to diff. ;;;Comparing and
;;; patching files is easy with ediff when you can see the screen.
;;; ;;;This module provides Emacspeak extensions to work fluently
;;; ;;;with ediff. Try it out, it's an excellent example of why
;;; Emacspeak is better than a traditional screenreader. This module
;;; was originally written to interface to the old ediff.el bundled
;;; with GNU Emacs 19.28 and earlier. It has been updated to work
;;; with the newer and much larger ediff system found in Emacs 19.29
;;; and later.
;;;
;;; When using under modern versions of Emacs, I recommend setting
;;; (setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
;;; so that Emacs always displays Ediff windows in a single frame.
;;; Code:
