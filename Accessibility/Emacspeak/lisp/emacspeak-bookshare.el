;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:
;;; BOOKSHARE == http://www.bookshare.org
;;; provides book access to print-disabled users.
;;; It provides a simple Web  API http://developer.bookshare.org
;;; This module implements an Emacspeak Bookshare client.
;;; @subsection  requirements
;;; @itemize
;;; @item You need to get your own API key
;;; @item You need Emacs built with libxml2 support
;;; @end itemize
;;;
;;; @subsection Usage
;;; The main entry point is command @code{emacspeak-bookshare} bound to @kbd{C-e C-b}.
;;; This creates a special @emph{Bookshare Interaction} buffer that is
;;; placed in @emph{emacspeak-bookshare-mode}.
;;; Se the help for that mode on detailed usage instructions and key-bindings.
;;;
;;;@subsection Sample Interaction
;;;
;;; Assuming you have correctly setup your API key:
;;; @itemize
;;;@item Customize group @code{emacspeak-bookshare} by pressing @kbd{C-h G}.
;;;@item  Press @kbd{C-e C-b} to open or switch to the Bookshare buffer.
;;; @item Perform a search @kbd{a} or @kbd{t} for author or title search.
;;; @item You will be prompted for your Bookshare password if this is
;;; the first time.
;;; @item The password will be saved to your configured
;;; @code{auth-source} --- usually @code{~/.authinfo.gpg}.
;;; You can also use @code{password-store[.]}
;;; @item The results of the search appear in the Bookshare buffer.
;;; Audio formatting and auditory icons convey if  a result is already available locally.
;;; @item If not available locally, press @kbd{D} to download the content.
;;; @item Press @kbd{U} to unpack the downloaded content.
;;;@item Press @kbd{e} to  display the entire book.
;;;@item Press @kbd{c} to display the table of contents.
;;; @item Now, use all of EWW  @xref{emacspeak-eww} extensions  and profit!
;;;@end itemize
;;; Code:
