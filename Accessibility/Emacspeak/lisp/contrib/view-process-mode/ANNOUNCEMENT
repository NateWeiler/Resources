Hello,

I've written a lisp package for the XEmacs (lemacs) and the FSF Emacs
19, which provides a new mode - the "view-process-mode".   

The name of the package is hm--view-process-2.4.tar.gz.
You can get this package from one of the following places:
	ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de:/pub/editors/xemacs/contrib
	sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/apps/editors/emacs/

With that mode it is possible to view processes on a UNIX system in an
emacs buffer. One can send signals to the processes or filter and sort
the buffer to find a special group of processes. The filtering and
sorting can be done on a region or on the whole output.  The filter
and sorter can use the whole line or single fields (like the command
field or the size field).

A signal can be send to all processes in a region or only to one
process.

The mode provides also some help functions to display explanations
over the output fields and their values.

It is also possible to view and kill processes on a remote machine via
rsh.

The mode commands can be called with special keybindings or with menu
items.  Each function, which can be run on regions and on the whole
output, has a generic interface, which determines the state of the
region and calls then the appropriate command.

Faces are used to highlight the header line and processes which should be
killed.

The mode is tested on Suns under SunOS 4.1.x and 5.x, on SGI's, HP's
and on Linux PC's.

Send any hints or bugs to: muenkel@tnt.uni-hannover.de
