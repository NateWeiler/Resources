;;; Commentary:
;;; Speech-enable org-drill ---

;;; Org-Drill is an extension for Org
;;; mode(http://orgmode.org/). Org-Drill uses a [spaced
;;; repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
;;; algorithm to conduct interactive "drill sessions", using org files
;;; as sources of facts to be memorised. Each topic is treated as a
;;; "flash card". The material to be remembered is presented to the
;;; student in random order. The student rates his or her recall of
;;; each item, and this information is used to schedule the item for
;;; later revision.
