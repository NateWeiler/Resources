;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;; Emacspeak's table browsing mode allows one to
;;; efficiently access  content that is tabular in nature.
;;; That module also provides functions for inferring table
;;; structure where possible.
;;; Often, such structure is hard to infer automatically
;;; --but might be known to the user 
;;; e.g. treat columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table
;;; and so on.
;;; This module allows the user to specify a conceptual grid
;;; that is "overlaid" on the region of text to turn it into
;;; a table for tabular browsing. For now, elements of the
;;; grid are "one line" high --but that may change in the
;;; future if necessary. This module is useful for browsing
;;; structured text files and the output from programs that
;;; tabulate their output.
;;; It's also useful for handling multicolumn text.
;;; The "grid" is specified as a list of (start end) tuples..
;;; Code:
