Use Emacs as you normally would,
emacspeak will provide you spoken feedback as you work.  Emacspeak also
provides commands for having parts of the current buffer, the
mode-line etc to be spoken.

If you are hearing this description as a result of pressing
\\[emacspeak-describe-emacspeak] you may want to press \\[dtk-stop] to
stop speech, and then use the arrow keys to move around in the Help
buffer to read the rest of this description, which includes a summary
of all emacspeak keybindings.

All emacspeak commands use \\[emacspeak-prefix-command] as a prefix
key.  You can also set the state of the TTS engine by using
\\[emacspeak-dtk-submap-command] as a prefix.  Here is a summary of all
emacspeak commands along with their bindings.  You need to precede the
keystrokes listed below with \\[emacspeak-prefix-command].

Emacspeak also provides a fluent speech extension to the Emacs
terminal emulator (eterm).  Note: You need to use the term package that
comes with emacs-19.29 and later.
