;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;; This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR.
;;; This module assumes that sane is installed and working
;;; for image acquisition,
;;; and that there is an OCR engine that can take acquired
;;; images and produce text.
;;; Prerequisites:
;;; Sane installed and working.
;;; scanimage to generate tiff files from scanner.
;;; tiffcp to compress the tiff file.
;;; working ocr executable 
;;; by default this module assumes that the OCR executable
;;; is named "ocr"

  " An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

2) An OCR engine.

1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
tiff file.  Then set variable
emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.

By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.

2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
available as /usr/bin/ocr.

Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.

The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-ocr bound to \\[emacspeak-ocr].  

This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the key-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to \\[emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory] will open this directory.

By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
\\[emacspeak-ocr-name-document].  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.
