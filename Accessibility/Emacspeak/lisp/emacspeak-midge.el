;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;; This module speech enables  midge.
;;; Midge is a MIDI composer/editor tool.
;;;From the package README file:
                                        ; Midge, for midi generator, is a text to midi translator.
                                        ; It creates type 1 (ie multitrack) midi files from text
                                        ; descriptions of music. It is a single perl script, which
                                        ; does not require any additional modules.
;;;The package also provides a convenient emacs mode for
;;;editing and playing  midge files.
;;;Midge's homepage is at:
