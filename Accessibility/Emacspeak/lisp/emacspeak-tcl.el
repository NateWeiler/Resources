  "Alist that controls indentation.
\(Actually, this really only controls what happens on continuation lines).
Each entry looks like `(KEYWORD TYPE ...)'.
Each type entry describes a sexp after the keyword, and can be one of:
* nil, meaning that this sexp has no particular type.
* tcl-expr, meaning that this sexp is an arithmetic expression.
* tcl-commands, meaning that this sexp holds Tcl commands.
* a string, which must exactly match the string at the corresponding
  position for a match to be made.

For example, the entry for the \"cl-loop\" command is:

   (\"cl-loop\" nil tcl-expr tcl-commands)

This means that the \"cl-loop\" command has three arguments.  The first
argument is ignored (for indentation purposes).  The second argument
is a Tcl expression, and the last argument is Tcl commands.")
