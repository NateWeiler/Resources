;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:
;;; Soundscapes @url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape}
;;; define an acoustic environment.
;;; Boodler  at @url{http://boodler.org} is a
;;; Python-based SoundScape generator.
;;; To use this module, first install boodler.
;;; Then install the soundscape packages (*.boop) files available
;;; at @url{http://boodler.org/lib}.
;;; Make sure boodler works and produces audio in your environment.
;;; finally install the Boodler packages  from
;;; emacspeak/scapes from the Emacspeak GitHub repository by running
;;; @code{cd emacspeak/scapes; make }
;;;
;;; When  boodler is set up and all packages installed, copy
;;; file emacspeak/scapes/soundscapes  to ~/.boodler/Collection.
;;; The above file lists all installed SoundScapes.
;;; Directory emacspeak/scapes also contains
;;; additional Boodler Agents and SoundScapes  that
;;; I have created for use with Emacspeak.
;;;
;;;  Module soundscape.el  defines Emacs conveniences for running
;;; Soundscapes. Main Entry Points:
;;;
;;;@itemize
;;; @item M-x soundscape-toggle -- Enables or
;;; disables automatic SoundScapes.
;;; @item M-x soundscape --
;;; runs a named SoundScape
;;; @item M-x soundscape-stop -- Stops a specified running Soundscape.
;;; @item M-x soundscape-kill -- Kills all running Soundscapes.
;;;@end itemize
;;;
;;; When automatic Soundscapes are enabled, SoundScapes are
;;;  started and stopped based on the current major
;;; mode. Active Soundscape  are displayed as part of the minor-mode-alist.
;;; Command emacspeak-speak-minor-mode-line can be used to have this spoken.
;;;
;;; Thus, SoundScapes can be thought of as reflecting the
;;; @emph{mood} of the current @emph{mode}.
;;; This package defines a single @var{soundscape-default-theme}
;;; that is loaded using @code{(soundscape-load soundscape-default-theme)}.
;;; Emacs modes that provide similar functionality e.g.,
;;; communication == email, IM, ... map to  the same @emph{mood}.
;;; Code:

;;; Automatic switching of soundscapes happens by sending a message to a UNIX domain socket in /tmp.
;;; This socket is created by Boodler on startup 
;;; ls /tmp/soundscape* to find the named pipe.
;;; To make sure the listener works correctly in your environment, 
;;;  try this in a shell:
;;; nc -U <name-of-socket>
;;; soundscape 1
;;; Above will switch to the first scape.
;;; soundscape 1 2 3 
;;; Will turn   on first three scapes.
;;; soundscape 0
;;;  Turns on null soundscape to give silence.
