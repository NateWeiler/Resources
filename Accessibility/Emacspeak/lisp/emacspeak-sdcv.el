;;; SDCV ==  Stardict  Dictionary Interface
;;; This module sets up Emacspeak for use with sdcv.
;;; You need to have  command-line sdcv installed.
;;; You can install additional stardict dictionaries, see
;;;  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/sdcv
;;; This module sets up Emacs module sdcv to use all the installed
;;; dictionaries found on the system.
