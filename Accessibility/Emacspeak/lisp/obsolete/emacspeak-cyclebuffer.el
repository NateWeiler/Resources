;; Commentary: 
;;This program speech-enables `cyclebuffer.el' package which provides much faster and more convenient switching between buffers.
;; Code:
(require 'emacspeak-preamble)
(defadvice cyclebuffer-forward (after emacspeak pre act comp)
  "Provide auditory feedback."
  (when (interactive-p)
    (emacspeak-auditory-icon 'select-object)
    (emacspeak-speak-mode-line)))

(defadvice cyclebuffer-backward (after emacspeak pre act comp)
  "Provide auditory feedback."
  (when (interactive-p)
    (emacspeak-auditory-icon 'select-object)
    (emacspeak-speak-mode-line)))

(provide 'emacspeak-cyclebuffer)
;;; local variables:
;;; byte-compile-dynamic: t
;;; end:
