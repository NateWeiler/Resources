;;; Commentary:
;;{{{  Introduction:

;;;  xml-parse.el provides an XML parser in Emacs Lisp.
;;; xml.el --- part of Emacs ---- also implements an XML parser.
;;; Unfortunately both parsers are relatively slow --- and also
;;; raise errors when parsing streams of XML

;;; xsltproc ---  part of the libxslt2 Gnome package ---
;;; implements a fast XSLT processor.

;;; There is a straight-forward equivalence between XML and Lisp
;;; S-Expressions 
;;; that  Lisp XML parsers emulate in the structure they return
;;; e.g. xml-parse.el;
;;; however it's inefficient to to construct this structure with
;;; a pure Emacs Lisp parser.

;;; This is still too slow --- possibly rewrite as a native
;;; libxml2 app.

;;; This module implements an alternative approach --- it uses a
;;; simple XSLT transform to convert XML into an S-Expression
;;; that can be read in  by Emacs Lisp.

;;; Pros: xsltproc is extremely fast, and by the time Emacs gets
;;; its  hands on the stream, it's in a form that Lisp can read
;;; in very efficiently.

;;; Cons: Requires an external process to launch xsltproc 
;;; Cons: At present the stylesheet quitely drops double-quote
;;; '"' characters in element content (to be fixed)
