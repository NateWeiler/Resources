;;; Commentary:

;; Voice Lock mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be displayed in
;; one face, strings in another, reserved words in another, and so on.
;;
;; Comments will be displayed in `voice-lock-comment-personality'.
;; Strings will be displayed in `voice-lock-string-personality'.
;; Regexps are used to display selected patterns in other faces.
;;
;; To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode RET.
;; When this minor mode is on, the personalities of the current line are updated with
;; every insertion or deletion.
;;
;; To turn Voice Lock mode on automatically, add this to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-voice-lock)
;;
;; Or if you want to turn Voice Lock mode on in many modes:
;;
;;  (global-voice-lock-mode t)
;;
;; Voiceification for a particular mode may be available in a number of levels
;; of decoration.  The higher the level, the more decoration, but the more time
;; it takes to voiceify.  See the variable `voice-lock-maximum-decoration', and
;; also the variable `voice-lock-maximum-size'.  Support modes for Voice Lock
;; mode can be used to speed up Voice Lock mode.  See `voice-lock-support-mode'.

;; Constructing patterns:
;;
;; See the documentation for the variable `voice-lock-keywords'.
;;
;; Nasty regexps of the form "bar\\(\\|lo\\)\\|f\\(oo\\|u\\(\\|bar\\)\\)\\|lo"
;; are made thusly: (make-regexp '("foo" "fu" "fubar" "bar" "barlo" "lo")) for
;; efficiency.  See /pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/functions/make-regexp.el.Z on
;; archive.cis.ohio-state.edu for this and other functions.

;; Adding patterns for modes that already support Voice Lock:
;;
;; Voice Lock mode uses the buffer local variable `voice-lock-keywords' for the
;; highlighting patterns.  This variable is set by Voice Lock mode from (a) the
;; buffer local variable `voice-lock-defaults', if non-nil, or (b) the global
;; variable `voice-lock-defaults-alist', if the major mode has an entry. 
;; Voice Lock mode is set up via (a) where a mode's patterns are distributed
;; with the mode's package library, (b) where a mode's patterns are distributed
;; with voice-lock.el itself.  An example of (a) is Pascal mode, an example of
;; (b) is C/C++ modes.  (Normally, the mechanism is (a); (b) is used where it
;; is not clear which package library should contain the pattern definitions.)
;;
;; If, for a particular mode, mechanism (a) is used, you need to add your
;; patterns after that package library has loaded, e.g.:
;;
;;  (eval-after-load "pascal" '(add-to-list 'pascal-voice-lock-keywords ...))
;;
;; (Note that only one pattern can be added with `add-to-list'.  For multiple
;; patterns, use one `eval-after-load' form with one `setq' and `append' form,
;; or multiple `eval-after-load' forms each with one `add-to-list' form.)
;; If mechanism (b) is used, you need to add your patterns after voice-lock.el
;; itself has loaded, e.g.:
;;
;;  (eval-after-load "voice-lock" '(add-to-list 'c-voice-lock-keywords ...))
;;
;; Which variable you should add to depends on what level of voiceification you
;; choose and what level is supported.  If you choose the maximum level, by
;; setting the variable `voice-lock-maximum-decoration', you change a different
;; variable.  Maximum level patterns for C are `c-voice-lock-keywords-3', so:
;;
;;  (setq voice-lock-maximum-decoration t)
;;  (eval-after-load "voice-lock"
;;   '(add-to-list 'c-voice-lock-keywords-3
;;		   '("\\<FILE\\>" . voice-lock-type-personality)))
;;
;; To see which variable to set, see the buffer's value of `voice-lock-defaults'
;; or the mode's entry in the global value of `voice-lock-defaults-alist'.

;; Adding patterns for modes that do not support Voice Lock:
;;
;; If you add patterns for a new mode, say foo.el's `foo-mode', say in which
;; you don't want syntactic voiceification to occur, you can make Voice Lock mode
;; use your regexps when turning on Voice Lock by adding to `foo-mode-hook':
;;
;;  (add-hook 'foo-mode-hook
;;   '(lambda () (make-local-variable 'voice-lock-defaults)
;;               (setq voice-lock-defaults '(foo-voice-lock-keywords t))))

;; What is voiceification for?  You might say, "It's to make my code look nice."
;; I think it should be for adding information in the form of cues.  These cues
;; should provide you with enough information to both (a) distinguish between
;; different items, and (b) identify the item meanings, without having to read
;; the items and think about it.  Therefore, voiceification allows you to think
;; less about, say, the structure of code, and more about, say, why the code
;; doesn't work.  Or maybe it allows you to think less and drift off to sleep.
;;
;; So, here are my opinions/advice/guidelines:
;; 
;; - Highlight conceptual objects, such as function and variable names, and
;;   different objects types differently, i.e., (a) and (b) above, highlight
;;   function names differently to variable names.
;; - Keep the personalities distinct from each other as far as possible.
;;   i.e., (a) above.
;; - Use the same face for the same conceptual object, across all modes.
;;   i.e., (b) above, all modes that have items that can be thought of as, say,
;;   keywords, should be highlighted with the same face, etc.
;; - Make the face attributes fit the concept as far as possible.
;;   i.e., function names might be a bold colour such as blue, comments might
;;   be a bright colour such as red, character strings might be brown, because,
;;   err, strings are brown (that was not the reason, please believe me).
;; - Don't use a non-nil OVERRIDE unless you have a good reason.
;;   Only use OVERRIDE for special things that are easy to define, such as the
;;   way `...' quotes are treated in strings and comments in Emacs Lisp mode.
;;   Don't use it to, say, highlight keywords in commented out code or strings.
;; - Err, that's it.

;; Voiceification variables --personalities defined in voice-aux.el
(defvar voice-lock-keywords nil
  "*A list of the keywords to highlight.
Each element should be of the form:

 MATCHER
 (MATCHER . MATCH)
 (MATCHER . VOICENAME)
 (MATCHER . HIGHLIGHT)
 (MATCHER HIGHLIGHT ...)
 (eval . FORM)

where HIGHLIGHT should be either MATCH-HIGHLIGHT or MATCH-ANCHORED.

FORM is an expression, whose value should be a keyword element, evaluated when
the keyword is (first) used in a buffer.  This feature can be used to provide a
keyword that can only be generated when Voice Lock mode is actually turned on.

For highlighting single items, typically only MATCH-HIGHLIGHT is required.
However, if an item or (typically) items are to be highlighted following the
instance of another item (the anchor) then MATCH-ANCHORED may be required.

MATCH-HIGHLIGHT should be of the form:

 (MATCH VOICENAME OVERRIDE LAXMATCH)

Where MATCHER can be either the regexp to search for, or the function name to
call to make the search (called with one argument, the limit of the search).
MATCH is the subexpression of MATCHER to be highlighted.  VOICENAME is an
expression whose value is the personality name to use.  VOICENAME's default attributes
may be defined in `voice-lock-personality-attributes'.

OVERRIDE and LAXMATCH are flags.  If OVERRIDE is t, existing voiceification may
be overwritten.  If `keep', only parts not already voiceified are highlighted.
If `prepend' or `append', existing voiceification is merged with the new, in
which the new or existing voiceification, respectively, takes precedence.
If LAXMATCH is non-nil, no error is signaled if there is no MATCH in MATCHER.

For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):

 \"\\\\\\=<foo\\\\\\=>\"		Discrete occurrences of \"foo\" in the value of the
			variable `voice-lock-keyword-personality'.
 (\"fu\\\\(bar\\\\)\" . 1)	Substring \"bar\" within all occurrences of \"fubar\" in
			the value of `voice-lock-keyword-personality'.
 (\"fubar\" . fubar-personality)	Occurrences of \"fubar\" in the value of `fubar-personality'.
 (\"foo\\\\|bar\" 0 foo-bar-personality t)
			Occurrences of either \"foo\" or \"bar\" in the value
			of `foo-bar-personality', even if already highlighted.

MATCH-ANCHORED should be of the form:

 (MATCHER PRE-MATCH-FORM POST-MATCH-FORM MATCH-HIGHLIGHT ...)

Where MATCHER is as for MATCH-HIGHLIGHT with one exception.  The limit of the
search is currently guaranteed to be (no greater than) the end of the line.
PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are evaluated before the first, and after
the last, instance MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER is used.  Therefore they can be
used to initialise before, and cleanup after, MATCHER is used.  Typically,
PRE-MATCH-FORM is used to move to some position relative to the original
MATCHER, before starting with MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER.  POST-MATCH-FORM might
be used to move, before resuming with MATCH-ANCHORED's parent's MATCHER.

For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):

 (\"\\\\\\=<anchor\\\\\\=>\" (0 anchor-personality) (\"\\\\\\=<item\\\\\\=>\" nil nil (0 item-personality)))

 Discrete occurrences of \"anchor\" in the value of `anchor-personality', and subsequent
 discrete occurrences of \"item\" (on the same line) in the value of `item-personality'.
 (Here PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are nil.  Therefore \"item\" is
 initially searched for starting from the end of the match of \"anchor\", and
 searching for subsequent instance of \"anchor\" resumes from where searching
 for \"item\" concluded.)

Note that the MATCH-ANCHORED feature is experimental; in the future, we may
replace it with other ways of providing this functionality.

These regular expressions should not match text which spans lines.  While
\\[voice-lock-voiceify-buffer] handles multi-line patterns correctly, updating
when you edit the buffer does not, since it considers text one line at a time.

Be very careful composing regexps for this list;
the wrong pattern can dramatically slow things down!")

Each item should be a list of the form:

 (MAJOR-MODE . (KEYWORDS KEYWORDS-ONLY CASE-FOLD SYNTAX-ALIST SYNTAX-BEGIN
                ...))

where MAJOR-MODE is a symbol.  KEYWORDS may be a symbol (a variable or function
whose value is the keywords to use for voiceification) or a list of symbols.
If KEYWORDS-ONLY is non-nil, syntactic voiceification (strings and comments) is
not performed.  If CASE-FOLD is non-nil, the case of the keywords is ignored
when voiceifying.  If SYNTAX-ALIST is non-nil, it should be a list of cons pairs
of the form (CHAR-OR-STRING . STRING) used to set the local Voice Lock syntax
table, for keyword and syntactic voiceification (see `modify-syntax-entry').

If SYNTAX-BEGIN is non-nil, it should be a function with no args used to move
backwards outside any enclosing syntactic block, for syntactic voiceification.
Typical values are `beginning-of-line' (i.e., the start of the line is known to
be outside a syntactic block), or `beginning-of-defun' for programming modes or
`backward-paragraph' for textual modes (i.e., the mode-dependent function is
known to move outside a syntactic block).  If nil, the beginning of the buffer
is used as a position outside of a syntactic block, in the worst case.

These item elements are used by Voice Lock mode to set the variables
`voice-lock-keywords', `voice-lock-keywords-only',
`voice-lock-keywords-case-fold-search', `voice-lock-syntax-table' and
`voice-lock-beginning-of-syntax-function', respectively.

Further item elements are alists of the form (VARIABLE . VALUE) and are in no
particular order.  Each VARIABLE is made buffer-local before set to VALUE.

Currently, appropriate variables include `voice-lock-mark-block-function'.
If this is non-nil, it should be a function with no args used to mark any
enclosing block of text, for voiceification via \\[voice-lock-voiceify-block].
Typical values are `mark-defun' for programming modes or `mark-paragraph' for
textual modes (i.e., the mode-dependent function is known to put point and mark
around a text block relevant to that mode).

Other variables include those for buffer-specialised voiceification functions,
`voice-lock-voiceify-buffer-function', `voice-lock-unvoiceify-buffer-function',
`voice-lock-voiceify-region-function', `voice-lock-unvoiceify-region-function',

   value of the variable `voice-lock-keywords'.

You can enable Voice Lock mode in any major mode automatically by turning on in
the major mode's hook.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-voice-lock)

Alternatively, you can use Global Voice Lock mode to automagically turn on Voice
Lock mode in buffers whose major mode supports it and whose major mode is one
of `voice-lock-global-modes'.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (global-voice-lock-mode t)

There are a number of support modes that may be used to speed up Voice Lock mode
in various ways, specified via the variable `voice-lock-support-mode'.  Where
major modes support different levels of voiceification, you can use the variable
`voice-lock-maximum-decoration' to specify which level you generally prefer.
When you turn Voice Lock mode on/off the buffer is voiceified/devoiceified, though
voiceification occurs only if the buffer is less than `voice-lock-maximum-size'.

For example, to specify that Voice Lock mode use use Lazy Lock mode as a support
mode and use maximum levels of voiceification, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (setq voice-lock-support-mode 'lazy-voice-lock-mode)
 (setq voice-lock-maximum-decoration t)

To voiceify a buffer, without turning on Voice Lock mode and regardless of buffer
size, you can use \\[voice-lock-voiceify-buffer].

To voiceify a block (the function or paragraph containing point, or a number of
lines around point), perhaps because modification on the current line caused
syntactic change on other lines, you can use \\[voice-lock-voiceify-block].

The default Voice Lock mode personalities and their attributes are defined in the
variable `voice-lock-personality-attributes', and Voice Lock mode default settings in
the variable `voice-lock-defaults-alist'.  You can set your own default settings
for some mode, by setting a buffer local value for `voice-lock-defaults', via
its mode hook."

;; Global Voice Lock mode.
;;
;; A few people have hassled in the past for a way to make it easier to turn on
;; Voice Lock mode, without the user needing to know for which modes s/he has to
;; turn it on, perhaps the same way hilit19.el/hl319.el does.  I've always
;; balked at that way, as I see it as just re-moulding the same problem in
;; another form.  That is; some person would still have to keep track of which
;; modes (which may not even be distributed with Emacs) support Voice Lock mode.
;; The list would always be out of date.  And that person might have to be me.

;; Implementation.
;;
;; In a previous discussion the following hack came to mind.  It is a gross
;; hack, but it generally works.  We use the convention that major modes start
;; by calling the function `kill-all-local-variables', which in turn runs
;; functions on the hook variable `change-major-mode-hook'.  We attach our
;; function `voice-lock-change-major-mode' to that hook.  Of course, when this
;; hook is run, the major mode is in the process of being changed and we do not
;; know what the final major mode will be.  So, `voice-lock-change-major-mode'
;; only (a) notes the name of the current buffer, and (b) adds our function
;; `turn-on-voice-lock-if-enabled' to the hook variables `find-file-hooks' and
;; `post-command-hook' (for buffers that are not visiting files).  By the time
;; the functions on the first of these hooks to be run are run, the new major
;; mode is assumed to be in place.  This way we get a Voice Lock function run
;; when a major mode is turned on, without knowing major modes or their hooks.
;;
;; Naturally this requires that (a) major modes run `kill-all-local-variables',
;; as they are supposed to do, and (b) the major mode is in place after the
;; file is visited or the command that ran `kill-all-local-variables' has
;; finished, whichever the sooner.  Arguably, any major mode that does not
;; follow the convension (a) is broken, and I can't think of any reason why (b)
;; would not be met (except `gnudoit' on non-files).  However, it is not clean.
;;
;; Probably the cleanest solution is to have each major mode function run some
;; hook, e.g., `major-mode-hook', but maybe implementing that change is
;; impractical.  I am personally against making `setq' a macro or be advised,
;; or have a special function such as `set-major-mode', but maybe someone can
;; come up with another solution?

;; User interface.
;;
;; Although Global Voice Lock mode is a pseudo-mode, I think that the user
;; interface should conform to the usual Emacs convention for modes, i.e., a
;; command to toggle the feature (`global-voice-lock-mode') with a variable for
;; finer control of the mode's behaviour (`voice-lock-global-modes').
;;
;; I don't think it is better that the feature be enabled via a variable, since
;; it does not conform to the usual convention.  I don't think the feature
;; should be enabled by loading voice-lock.el, since other mechanisms such as
;; M-x voice-lock-mode RET or (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-voice-lock) would
;; cause Voice Lock mode to be turned on everywhere, and it is not intuitive or
;; informative because loading a file tells you nothing about the feature or
;; how to control it.  It would be contrary to the Principle of Least Surprise.
