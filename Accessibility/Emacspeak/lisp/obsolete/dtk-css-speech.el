;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:
;;; The CSS Speech Style Sheet specification defines a number of
;;; abstract device independent voice properties.
;;; A setting conforming to the CSS speech specification can be
;;; represented in elisp as a structure.

;;; We will refer to this structure as a "speech style".
;;; This structure needs to be mapped to device dependent codes to
;;; produce the desired effect.
;;; This module forms a bridge between User Agents e.g. Emacs-w3 that
;;; wish to implement a speech style sheet
;;; and Emacspeak's dtk-voices module.
;;; Emacspeak produces voice change effects by examining the value of
;;; text-property 'personality.

;;; Think of a buffer of formatted text along with the text-property
;;; 'personality appropriately set as a "aural display list".
;;; Applications like W3 that produce such formatted buffers  call function
;;; tts-personality-from-speech-style  with a  "speech-style"
;;; --a structure as defined in this module and get back a symbol that
;;; they then assign to the value of property 'personality.
;;;Emacspeak's rendering engine then does the needful at the time
;;;speech is produced.
;;; Function tts-personality-from-speech-style does the following:
;;; Takes as input a "speech style"
;;;(1)  Computes a symbol that will be used henceforth to refer to this
;;; specific speech style.
;;; (2) Examines emacspeak's internal voice table to see if this
;;; speech style has a voice already defined.
;;; If so it returns immediately.
;;; Otherwise, it does the additional work of defining a dtk-voice for
;;; future use.
;;; See module dtk-voices.el to see how voices are defined.
