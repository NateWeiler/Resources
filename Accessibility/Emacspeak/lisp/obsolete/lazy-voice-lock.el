;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;; To make visiting buffers in `voice-lock-mode' faster by making voiceification
;; be demand-driven, deferred and stealthy.
;; Voiceification only occurs when, and where, necessary.
;;
;; See caveats and feedback below.
;; See also the fast-lock package.  (But don't use them at the same time!)

;; Installation:
;; 
;; Put in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;; (setq voice-lock-support-mode 'lazy-voice-lock-mode)
;;
;; Start up a new Emacs and use voice-lock as usual (except that you can use the
;; so-called "gaudier" voiceification regexps on big files without frustration).
;;
;; In a buffer (which has `voice-lock-mode' enabled) which is at least
;; `lazy-voice-lock-minimum-size' characters long, buffer voiceification will not
;; occur and only the visible portion of the buffer will be voiceified.  Motion
;; around the buffer will voiceify those visible portions not previously
;; voiceified.  If stealth voiceification is enabled, buffer voiceification will
;; occur in invisible parts of the buffer after `lazy-voice-lock-stealth-time'
;; seconds of idle time.  If on-the-fly voiceification is deferred, on-the-fly
;; voiceification will occur after `lazy-voice-lock-defer-time' seconds of idle time.

;; User-visible differences with version 1:
;;
;; - Version 2 can defer on-the-fly voiceification.  Therefore you need not, and
;; should not, use defer-lock.el with this version of lazy-voice-lock.el.
;;
;; A number of variables have changed meaning:
;;
;; - A value of nil for the variable `lazy-voice-lock-minimum-size' means never turn
;; on demand-driven voiceification.  In version 1 this meant always turn on
;; demand-driven voiceification.  If you really want demand-driven voiceification
;; regardless of buffer size, set this variable to 0.
;;
;; - The variable `lazy-voice-lock-stealth-lines' cannot have a nil value.  In
;; version 1 this meant use `window-height' as the maximum number of lines to
;; voiceify as a stealth chunk.  This makes no sense; stealth voiceification is
;; of a buffer, not a window.

;; Implementation differences with version 1:
;;
;; - Version 1 of lazy-voice-lock.el is a bit of a hack.  Version 1 demand-driven
;; voiceification, the core feature of lazy-voice-lock.el, is implemented by placing a
;; function on `post-command-hook'.  This function voiceifies where necessary,
;; i.e., where a window scroll has occurred.  However, there are a number of
;; problems with using `post-command-hook':
;;
;; (a) As the name suggests, `post-command-hook' is run after every command,
;;     i.e., frequently and regardless of whether scrolling has occurred.
;; (b) Scrolling can occur during a command, when `post-command-hook' is not
;;     run, i.e., it is not necessarily run after scrolling has occurred.
;; (c) When `post-command-hook' is run, there is nothing to suggest where
;;     scrolling might have occurred, i.e., which windows have scrolled.
;;
;; Thus lazy-voice-lock.el's function is called almost as often as possible, usually
;; when it need not be called, yet it is not always called when it is needed.
;; Also, lazy-voice-lock.el's function must check each window to see if a scroll has
;; occurred there.  Worse still, lazy-voice-lock.el's function must voiceify a region
;; twice as large as necessary to make sure the window is completely voiceified.
;; Basically, `post-command-hook' is completely inappropriate for lazy-voice-lock.el.
;;
;; Ideally, we want to attach lazy-voice-lock.el's function to a hook that is run
;; only when scrolling occurs, e.g., `window-start' has changed, and tells us
;; as much information as we need, i.e., the window and its new buffer region.
;; Richard Stallman implemented a `window-scroll-functions' for Emacs 19.30.
;; Functions on it are run when `window-start' has changed, and are supplied
;; with the window and the window's new `window-start' position.  (It would be
;; better if it also supplied the window's new `window-end' position, but that
;; is calculated as part of the redisplay process, and the functions on
;; `window-scroll-functions' are run before redisplay has finished.)  Thus, the
;; hook deals with the above problems (a), (b) and (c).
;;
;; If only life was that easy.  Version 2 demand-driven voiceification is mostly
;; implemented by placing a function on `window-scroll-functions'.  However,
;; not all scrolling occurs when `window-start' has changed.  A change in
;; window size, e.g., via C-x 1, or a significant deletion, e.g., of a number
;; of lines, causes `window-end' to change without changing `window-start'.
;; Arguably, these events are not scrolling events, but voiceification must
;; occur for lazy-voice-lock.el to work.  Hooks `window-size-change-functions' and
;; `redisplay-end-trigger-functions' were added for these circumstances.
;;
;; Ben Wing thinks these hooks are "horribly horribly kludgy", and implemented
;; a `pre-idle-hook', a `mother-of-all-post-command-hooks', for XEmacs 19.14.
;; He then hacked up a version 1 lazy-voice-lock.el to use `pre-idle-hook' rather
;; than `post-command-hook'.  Whereas functions on `post-command-hook' are
;; called almost as often as possible, functions on `pre-idle-hook' really are
;; called as often as possible, even when the mouse moves and, on some systems,
;; while XEmacs is idle.  Thus, the hook deals with the above problem (b), but
;; unfortunately it makes (a) worse and does not address (c) at all.
;;
;; I freely admit that `redisplay-end-trigger-functions' and, to a much lesser
;; extent, `window-size-change-functions' are not pretty.  However, I feel that
;; a `window-scroll-functions' feature is cleaner than a `pre-idle-hook', and
;; the result is faster and smaller, less intrusive and more targeted, code.
;; Since `pre-idle-hook' is pretty much like `post-command-hook', there is no
;; point in making this version of lazy-voice-lock.el work with it.  Anyway, that's
;; Lit 30 of my humble opinion.
;;
;; - Version 1 stealth voiceification is also implemented by placing a function
;; on `post-command-hook'.  This function waits for a given amount of time,
;; and, if Emacs remains idle, voiceifies where necessary.  Again, there are a
;; number of problems with using `post-command-hook':
;;
;; (a) Functions on `post-command-hook' are run sequentially, so this function
;;     can interfere with other functions on the hook, and vice versa.
;; (b) This function waits for a given amount of time, so it can interfere with
;;     various features that are dealt with by Emacs after a command, e.g.,
;;     region highlighting, asynchronous updating and keystroke echoing.
;; (c) Voiceification may be required during a command, when `post-command-hook'
;;     is not run.  (Version 2 deferred voiceification only.)
;;
;; Again, `post-command-hook' is completely inappropriate for lazy-voice-lock.el.
;; Richard Stallman and Morten Welinder implemented internal Timers and Idle
;; Timers for Emacs 19.31.  Functions can be run independently at given times
;; or after given amounts of idle time.  Thus, the feature deals with the above
;; problems (a), (b) and (c).  Version 2 deferral and stealth are implemented
;; by functions on Idle Timers.  (A function on XEmacs' `pre-idle-hook' is
;; similar to an Emacs Idle Timer function with a fixed zero second timeout.
;; Hey, maybe I could stop using `window-scroll-functions' for demand-driven
;; voiceification and use a zero second Emacs Idle Timer instead?  Only joking!)

;; Caveats:
;;
;; Lazy Lock mode does not work efficiently with Outline mode.  This is because
;; when in Outline mode, although text may be hidden (not visible in the
;; window), the text is visible to Emacs Lisp code (not surprisingly) and Lazy
;; Lock voiceifies it mercilessly.  Maybe it will be fixed one day.
;;
;; Because buffer text is not necessarily voiceified, other packages that expect
;; buffer text to be voiceified inVoice Lock mode either might not work as
;; expected, or might not display buffer text as expected.  An example of the
;; latter is `occur', which copies lines of buffer text into another buffer.
;;
;; In Emacs 19.30, Lazy Lock mode does not ensure that an existing buffer is
;; voiceified if it is made visible via a minibuffer-less command that replaces
;; an existing window's buffer (e.g., via the Buffers menu).  Upgrade!
;;
;; In Emacs 19.30, Lazy Lock mode does not work well with Transient Mark mode
;; or modes based on Comint mode (e.g., Shell mode), and also interferes with
;; the echoing of keystrokes in the minibuffer.  This is because of the way
;; deferral and stealth have to be implemented for Emacs 19.30.  Upgrade!
;;
;; Currently XEmacs does not have the features to support this version of
;; lazy-voice-lock.el.  Maybe it will one day.

If t, means defer-driven voiceification is performed.  This means voiceification

  "Toggle Lazy Lock mode.
With arg, turn Lazy Lock mode on if and only if arg is positive.  Enable it
automatically in your `~/.emacs' by:

 (setq voice-lock-support-mode 'lazy-voice-lock-mode)

When Lazy Lock mode is enabled, voiceification can be lazy in a number of ways:

 - Demand-driven buffer voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-minimum-size' is non-nil.
   This means initial voiceification does not occur if the buffer is greater
   than `lazy-voice-lock-minimum-size' characters in length.  Instead, voiceification
   occurs when necessary, such as when scrolling through the buffer would
   otherwise reveal unvoiceified areas.  This is useful if buffer voiceification
   is too slow for large buffers.

 - Defer-driven buffer voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-defer-driven' is non-nil.
   This means all voiceification is deferred, such as voiceification that occurs
   when scrolling through the buffer would otherwise reveal unvoiceified areas.
   Instead, these areas are seen momentarily unvoiceified.  This is useful if
   demand-driven voiceification is too slow to keep up with scrolling.

 - Deferred on-the-fly voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-defer-time' is non-nil.
   This means on-the-fly voiceification does not occur as you type.  Instead,
   voiceification is deferred until after `lazy-voice-lock-defer-time' seconds of
   Emacs idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  This is useful if on-the-fly
   voiceification is too slow to keep up with your typing.

 - Stealthy buffer voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.
   This means remaining unvoiceified areas of buffers are voiceified if Emacs has
   been idle for `lazy-voice-lock-stealth-time' seconds, while Emacs remains idle.
   This is useful if any buffer has demand- or defer-driven voiceification.
