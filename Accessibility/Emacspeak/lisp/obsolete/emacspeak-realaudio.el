;;; Assuming you have a correctly configured RealAudio
;;; player, this package provides single click access to
;;; starting and stopping a RealAudio stream from anywhere
;;; on the Emacspeak desktop.  Before using this package,
;;; make sure that your realaudio player works outside
;;; Emacs. Then set variable Emacspeak-realaudio-player to
;;; point to the program you use to play RealAudio streams.
