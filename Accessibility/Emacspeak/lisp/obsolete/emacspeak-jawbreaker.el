;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:

;;; MozRepl provides a read-eval-print loop into Firefox
;;;  Module emacspeak-moz provides convenient functions for driving MozRepl
;;; See http://repo.hyperstruct.net/mozlab
;;; Using that module, you can connect two large pigs ---
;;; Emacs and Firefox  via a socket ---
;;; the result as you can expect is to produce piglets.
;;; emacspeak-jawbreaker is a piglet that enables one to play 
;;; The JawBreaker game from within Emacspeak.
;;; I run Firefox headless using the etc/firebox script
;;; And I have Fire Vox installed to provide the Firefox side of the spoken output.
