** emacspeak-kmacro.el:

** world clock:
Command  emacspeak-speak-time implements a world clock when
called                                 with an interactive
prefix                                 arg (C-u).
When called with two prefix args i.e. C-u twice, it sets the
timezone                                 as well --- useful for
international                                 travel.

** Browsing buffers:
Command emacspeak-speak-browse-buffer now browses by personality
chunks rather than by paragraphs.
The older functionality of browsing by paragraphs is still
accessible through emacspeak-speak-continuously 

**emacspeak-sigbegone.el

Speech-enables sigbegone --- a package for  recognizing email
signatures.


** emacspeak-ediary.el:

Speech-enables ediary --- a special mode for working with the
.diary file.


** emacspeak-damlite.el:
Speech-enables damlite-mode --- a special mode for creating and
maintaining  DAML ontologies using RDF.

** emacspeak-pronounce:

User defined pronunciations have been augmented.
Pronunciations can now be specified either as a string,
or in more complex situations as a cons (matcher . pronouncer).
For examples of use, see emacspeak-vm.el
which uses this feature to define an appropriate pronunciation
rule for ISO DateTime values.

** TTS Support:

TTS specific code is now restricted in modules of the form
<synth-name>-voices.el.
Support for additional  TTS engines 
should be modeled on the code in dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el
