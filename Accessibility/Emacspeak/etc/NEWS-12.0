* Emacspeak 12.0 Additions And Changes:

Emacspeak 12.0 provides the following user level enhancements:


* Enhancements to single click Websearch:   emacspeak-websearch.el

Module emacspeak-websearch provides single click WWW search
functionality from anywhere on the Emacspeak audio desktop.
This release adds support for a few more popular search
engines --see command emacspeak-websearch-dispatch bound to
`C-e ?'.

This version also takes the first step toward a
speech-enabled semantic WWW by retrieving and presenting
structured data where available --rather than presentational
HTML pages. For an example, see the historical stock data
retrieval utilities that come with emacspeak-websearch.


* Speech-enabled CVS access via package pcl-cvs 

* Speech-enabled JDEbug  

* Speech-enabled instant messenger via package TNT 

* RealAudio:

** Structured  hierarchy of realaudio shortcuts 

** Support for browsing realaudio metafiles 

** Support for  commencing play at a specific time stamp in
   

*  Changes relevant to developpers:

** Plugin mechanism for  contributed TTS servers:

File servers/.servers in the emacspeak directory lists
available TTS serves.
Emacspeak consults this file upon startup to 
decide what TTS servers are available at a given
installation. 
Authors of contributed servers are advised to add the name
of their server to this file at install time.


** Code has been reorganized into  sub-directories.

** SourceForge:

 Code is now checked into CVS at sourceforge 
and is available for anonymous cvs access.
