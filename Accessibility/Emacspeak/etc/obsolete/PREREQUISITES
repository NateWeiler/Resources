Here are the things you *must* have before you attempt 
to install or run Emacspeak.

* Emacs

You need to have a full emacs installation.
This means you should have installed both the X and no-X
versions of Emacs --even if yu plan to run 
Emacspeak outside the X windows system.

* TCL 

You need to have a full TCL environment installed.
This includes tclsh, tcl (extended tcl)
and the associated development libraries and header files.

* Audio

The ability to produce speech.

If you intend to use your sound card to produce speech, 
first make sure that your sound card is configured and
working --you wll not make much progress with Emacspeak
without  this basic capability.
See the Linux Sound HOWTO and other related documents for
getting your sound card configured and working.

*  TTS (Text To Speech)

 If using a software TTS system like IBM ViaVoice 
acquire, install and test that system independent of
Emacspeak and ensure that it is working correctly.

*  TTS Server

 Confirm that whatever TTS engine you've chosen to use is
   supported by Emacspeak
--see the Emacspeak WWW site for what TTS systems are
   supported.

* Midi  (optional)

 If you intend using software TTS with your sound card
   providing sound output,
be aware that many sound cards do not support multiple
   channels of audio under Linux.
If you intend to use Emacspeak's auditory icons (this is not
   essential)
you will need to get midi configured and working so you can
   use midi icons in conjunction with the wave device
   performing TTS.

You should begin installing and configuring Emacspeak 
only after you've performed *all* of the above steps.
