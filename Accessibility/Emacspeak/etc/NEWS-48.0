Author: T. V. Raman <tv.raman.tv@gmail.com>


* Emacspeak 48 -- Emacspeak 48 User Visible Changes
This version requires Emacs-25.1 or later.

** Emacs 26 Support 

Emacspeak 48 supports  new functionality  introduced in the upcoming
Emacs 26.1.


** Locate And Play Media 

Command ~emacspeak-m-player-locate-media~ bound to _Super-l_ to find
and play local media.
** Updated EPub Support 

Module ~emacspeak-epub~ support for Gutenberg has been updated.

** Updated Outloud TTS Server

The outloud server has been updated to work around some ALSA issues in
newer versions of Debian.

** Espeak-NG And Emacspeak

On newer Debian systems, espeak users are recommended to move to
espeak-ng by installing the corresponding espeak-ng and espeak
compatibility packages. This avoids portaudio issues, and also brings
all of the power of alsa --- including applying ladspa effects to TTS.

** Emacspeak Prompts 

Emacspeak now includes an ~emacspeak-prompts~ module that provides
high-quality spoken prompts as MP3 files.

** DBus Integration

Module ~emacspeak-dbus~ now provides auditory feedback when waking up
and unlocking ~gnome-screensaver~ via DBus integration.
It also provides  interactive command  ~emacspeak-dbus-lock-screen~
for locking the screen.
Support for package ~mpg123.el~ has been removed.

** MPlayer And Equalizer Presets 

Module ~emacspeak-m-player~ now implements a  set of equalizer presets
that can be selected via _e_ in MPlayer interaction.

** VLC

New module ~emacspeak-vlc~ implements  light-weight VLC interaction.

** Obsolete: emacspeak-mpg123.el

** Removing W3 Support 

Browser emacs-w3 no longer works with Emacs 26, and consequently,
module ~emacspeak-w3~ has been obsoleted, and all references to
emacs-w3 removed from the Emacspeak codebase.
