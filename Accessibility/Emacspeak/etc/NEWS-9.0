* Emacspeak 9.0 Additions And Changes:

Emacspeak 9.0 provides the following user level
enhancements:

* * FAQ List:

The Emacspeak distribution now comes with an FAQ list --you
can view this from within Emacspeak by pressing C-e F bound
to command emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq.
** emacspeak-speak-line now asks for confirmation 
before speaking extremely long lines. This is to avoid
accidentally stumbling 
on a binary file and causing the speech system untold pain.

**  Speech-enables supercite: emacspeak-supercite.el

Emacspeak now speech-enables the supercite package
--this helps in creating meaningful citations when
participating in email conversations.

** Speech enables sql-mode: emacspeak-sql.el

Emacspeak 9.0 speech-enables SQL mode to enable fluent
database interaction.

** Speech support for Emacs 20.3 enhancements:

Note: Make sure to run Emacs 20.3 in unibyte mode--
set your environment variable EMACS_UNIBYTE *before*
starting Emacs


*** Speech-enables package net-utils

This package is used to access
network diagnostic utilities.

*** Speech-enables package find-func

This package is used to locate Emacs
    source code.

This package  allows on-the-fly spell checking.

*** Speech-enables CPerl

This is an enhanced perl mode.

*** Hyperlink navigation in Emacs help buffers.

*** Speech-enables new register commands.

** PSGML Support:

Emacspeak now speech enables PSGML --a powerful SGML support
package. This allows for creating and maintaining structured
XML content.


** File operation utilities

You can now copy or link the file visited in the current
buffer with a single keystroke-- this is especially
convenient when editting local files before publishing them
to the WWW.

Copies current document to specified location

*** emacspeak-link-current-file

Hard links current document to specified location

*** emacspeak-symlink-current-file
