* Emacspeak 10.0 Additions And Changes:

Emacspeak 10.0 provides the following user level enhancements:

* Single click Websearch:   emacspeak-websearch.el

Module emacspeak-websearch provides single click WWW search
functionality from anywhere on the Emacspeak audio desktop
--see command emacspeak-websearch-dispatch bound to C-e ?.

* Search Emacspeak Mail Archives:

You can search the Emacspeak mail archives 
using command emacspeak-websearch-emacspeak-archive
bound to key C-h e


* Tabulating shell command output:

There is a new user level command to automatically run shell
level utilities  like vmstat and view the results as a
navigable table --see command 
emacspeak-speak-run-shell-command.

* DOM-based WWW Page Navigation:
There are two new commands for navigating WWW pages based on
the underlying Document Object Model (DOM).
Commands emacspeak-w3-next-doc-element and
emacspeak-w3-previous-doc-element
bound to `n' and `p' respectively move through the displayed
page. Note that W3 does not yet implement a full DOM
interface, and this navigation is therefore still evolving.

* Enhanced table browsing in W3:

In conjunction with the latest release of W3, Emacspeak now
provides even better table interaction.
You can now listen to contents on a given cell
--alternatively,  you can turn the current cell into a
stand-alone WWW page by using command 
w3-table-focus-on-this-cell.

* Document navigation in W3

There is a new experimental feature in emacspeak-w3
that allows you to move through the document elements on a
page.
Use commands emacspeak-w3-next-doc-element
and emacspeak-w3-previous-doc-element
bound to "n" and "p" in w3 mode.

* Enhanced Forms-mode Support:  emacspeak-forms.el

The forms-mode support has been significantly enhanced.
The Emacspeak source distribution now comes with some
samples in directory forms:

**forms/messages.el   Browse /var/adm/messages

** forms/apache-clf.el       Browse Apache log files in CLF
   format.

* Ability to filter lines:

There is a new user level command that allows you to
selectively filtter out portions of a line --see command
emacspeak-speak-line-set-column-filter.

* Monitoring Processes 
There is a new user option in comint mode buffers 
emacspeak-comint-output-monitor --set with command
emacspeak-toggle-comint-output-monitor 
--when turned on output in comint buffers will be
automatically spoken even if the comint buffer is not the
current buffer.
This is useful in conjunction with
emacspeak-toggle-comint-autospeak  in tracking process
activity.
For instance,  here is one sample usage:
have a shell buffer display a log file using tail -f 
e.g. /var/adm/messages or your apache server logs.
Turn on comint-autospeak and comint-monitor-output
in this buffer. Now, as you work in other buffers, output to
the comint buffer displaying the running log will be spoken
automatically.

* Loading Directory Specific Emacspeak Settings:

You can now store directory specific Emacspeak settings in a
file called .espeak.el
--modes like View-mode automatically load these settings
when you visit a file in that directory.
This is most useful for loading Emacspeak settings that are
specific to a particular electronic book.


* Dired Mode Enhancements:

** When you have a directory entry repeated via command
   emacspeak-speak-word, it is automatically spelt.
Thus, simply use C-e w while moving through directory
   listings to have the current entry spelt out.

* C Mode Enhancements:

** Dictionaries are automatically turned on in C mode and friends.

* Man-mode Changes:

You can have the current section spoken via keystroke M-spc
--see command 
emacspeak-man-speak-this-section.

* Outline Mode Enhancements:

Added user option
emacspeak-outline-dont-query-before-speaking to control if
commands emacspeak-outline-speak-previous-heading and
emacspeak-outline-speak-next-heading ask for confirmation.
