* Emacspeak 13.0 Additions And Changes:

Emacspeak 13.0 provides the following user level enhancements:

* Graphical Desktop Environments:


** Sawfish:
Added subdirectory `sawfish' containing a tts.jl module for
interfacing sawfish to the Emacspeak speech servers.
Directory sawfish also contains my personal sawfishrc file
as an example of how to load and use this package.
When set up, this speech-enables the sawfish window manager.


** emacspeak-Sawfish:
Speech-enables interaction with the sawfish window manager.

* Emacspeak Logo:

Emacspeak now has a visual and auditory logo.

** Visual: A 

picture of Hubbell --Yellow Labrador-- with a bubble coming
out of her mouth saying "Complete Audio Desktop" and the
caption "EMACSPEAK" under her picture; thanks to Hans
Zoebelein for the visual design.  This logo is used on the
Emacspeak WWW site, and is available as an XPM file in the
emacspeak/etc directory for use on graphical desktops.

** Auditory Logo:

Emacspeak.mp3 is a 4 second   MP3 file containing the first
few bars of Bach's Toccata And fugue.
The auditory logo is played as Emacspeak starts up.

* New Emacspeak Features:

** Sound Themes:
 In addition to the default 8k  auditory icons, you can now
 install alternative sound themes. Sound themes will be
 distributed separate  from the main emacspeak distribution.
