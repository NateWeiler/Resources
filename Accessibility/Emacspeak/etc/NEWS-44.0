** Multiple Media Players 

Module [[http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2015/11/listening-to-multiple-media-streams-on.html][emacspeak-m-player]] can now launch and control multiple media
player instances. Use C-e;\ to persist the current m-player session; Use a
prefix arg to give that session a name.

** Panning In MPlayer

Module emacspeak-m-player adds support for panning audio from the currently
playing stream from left to right.

** Ladspa And MPlayer

Module emacspeak-m-player  now  provides Ladspa integration with more
presets including an autopan+pinknoise setting suitable for
relaxation.

** Spatialized Chimes Theme 

Sound theme pan-chimes provides a spatialized theme generated from the
original =chimes= theme.

** Ladspa Workbench

Module =ladspa.el= implements a Ladspa workbench for the Emacspeak
desktop. 
It is integrated with =MPlayer=. 

**  Speech-Enabled ElPY:

Module =emacspeak-elpy.el= speech-enables package =ElPY= --- a Python IDE.

** SoundScapes:

[[http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2015/11/listening-to-multiple-media-streams-on][Soundscapes]] --- a continuous loop of softly playing sound-effects ---
can be automatically turned on and off to match the user's current
activity. Module ~soundscape.el~ implements SoundScapes using Python
package ~boodler~ --- see [[http://boodler.org]].


** Additional Emacspeak Soundscapes

Directory emacspeak/scapes includes Soundscapes developed for use on
the Audio Desktop.
These scapes will not be distributed as part of Emacspeak due to their
size --- they can be obtained from the GitHub repository.

A release snapshot can be found at
https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/releases/download/soundscape-1.1/soundscapes-1.1.tar.bz2

** Using CrossFeed With ALSA

File ~scapes/ladspa-asoundrc~ defines *crossfeed*, *reverb_crossfeed*
and *tap_reverb* virtual devices that can be used to enable enhanced
headphones listening --- works particularly well for soundscapes.

** MPlayer, HRTF And OpenAL

Module emacspeak-m-player provides a new command for invoking
~MPlayer~ with *OpenAL* as the output driver. This provides *HRTF* for
a better listening experience.

** Helm Support:

Module emacspeak-helm.el has been enhanced to provide better coverage of Helm use-cases.


** Browsing/Choosing Completions From Within The Minibuffer:

You can now use =C-n= and =C-p=  in the minibuffer to move through
displayed completion and =C-c= to select the current completion. 


* Knowledge Graph Search

Module ~emacspeak-webspace~ now provides an early implementation of
Google Knowledge Graph search.
