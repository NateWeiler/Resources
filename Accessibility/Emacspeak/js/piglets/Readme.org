These JS files were used to implement /Piglets/ in 2008 ----
Piglets were the result of  two large pigs mating --- AKA connecting
Emacs to Firefox via MozRepl.

Module emacspeak-piglets was  made obsolete in 2012.
These JS files are here  in case they prove useful in walking the DOM
in some future module.
