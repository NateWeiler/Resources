@section How To Contribute To This Manual

This manual is organized as a series of chapters, with each chapter in
a separate file.  If you feel capable of contributing to a specific
section, send out a message to the Emacspeak mailing list
@url{mailto:emacspeak@@cs.vassar.edu}.  You can then start adding
content to a local copy of the chapter to which you are contributing.
When you feel you have something to submit, mail out the file to the
emacspeak mailing list @MDash{} I'll integrate new content as it comes
in.

@node Authoring Guidelines
@section Authoring Guidelines

For this manual to hang together and make sense to the new user at
whom it is targeted, contributors need to stick to a consistent style.
If you plan to contribute content, you should take some time to read
the existing sections @MDash{} note that many of these are skeletal
and the first contributions will be to flesh these sections out.

If you are familiar with texinfo, go ahead and mark up your content
using texinfo.  If you are not, simply author the documentation you
create as plain formatted ASCII.  If you do submit files as texinfo
source, make sure to validate them at your end first by running the
files through @command{makeinfo} @MDash{} badly created or malformed
texinfo source takes more time to fix than marking up straight text.

@section Credits

This initial version draws heavily from the original Emacspeak user
manual, and includes contributions from Jim Van Zandt and Jason White.
Authors who contribute complete sections will be acknowledged here as
well as in the specific section they author.
