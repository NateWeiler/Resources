@cindex Emacs Keyboard Commands

This chapter gives an overview of all the keymaps used by Emacspeak.  For
a complete reference, see @xref{emacspeak}.  For basic usage, see
@xref{Basic Usage}.

Emacspeak uses the following keymaps, each of which are invoked by a
specific prefix key.
@table @kbd
@item C-e
The main Emacspeak keymap.
@item C-e d
The text-to-speech keymap.
@item C-;
The Emacspeak hyper keymap.
@item C-'
The emacspeak super keymap.
@item C-,
The Emacspeak alt keymap.
@item C-.
The Emacspeak super keymap.
@item C-e x
The emacspeak @kbd{x} keymap.
@item C-e C-x
The Emacspeak @kbd{C-x} keymap.
@end table

Primary Emacspeak commands start with @kbd{C-e}.  Following @kbd{C-e}
with @kbd{d} invokes commands that control the text-to-speech engine.
Note that silencing speech is an exception to this rule @MDash{} Speech
silence commands are placed directly on the primary emacspeak-keymap
(@kbd{C-e s} and @kbd{C-e .}).

In addition, Emacspeak introduces five additional keymaps for binding
its extensive set of facilities to convenient keystrokes.

When running under a windowing system, Emacs automatically receives
keys @kbd{C-;}, @kbd{C-'}, @kbd{C-,} and @kbd{C-.}.  When running on
the Linux console, these keys become available after loading the
custom Linux keymap found in @code{emacspeak/tvr/console-keymaps}
after checking out the emacspeak repository from
@url{https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak}.

Emacspeak defines personal keymaps accessible via @kbd{C-e x} and
@kbd{C-e C-x}.  For now, emacspeak does not bind any commands in keymap
@kbd{C-e C-x} @MDash{} this keymap is left for end-user personalization.

Note that the information presented in the following subsections can
also be viewed via Emacs' built-in Help system; e.g., Press @kbd{C-; 
C-h} to get a @code{*Help*} buffer that displays all keys bound in
@code{emacspeak-hyper-keymap}.
