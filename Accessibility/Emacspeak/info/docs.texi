@node acss-structure
@section acss-structure

The CSS Speech Style Sheet specification defines a number of
abstract device independent voice properties.
A setting conforming to the CSS speech specification can be
represented in elisp as a structure.

We will refer to this structure as a "speech style".  This
structure needs to be mapped to device dependent codes to produce
the desired effect.  This module forms a bridge between emacs
packages    that wish to implement audio formatting
and Emacspeak's TTS module.  Emacspeak produces voice
change effects by examining the value of text-property
'personality.

Think of a buffer of formatted text along with the text-property
'personality appropriately set as a "aural display list".
Applications like EWW that produce such formatted buffers  call function
acss-personality-from-speech-style  with a  "speech-style"
--a structure as defined in this module and get back a symbol that
they then assign to the value of property 'personality.
Emacspeak's rendering engine then does the needful at the time
speech is produced.
Function acss-personality-from-speech-style does the following:
Takes as input a "speech style"
(1)  Computes a symbol that will be used henceforth to refer to this
specific speech style.
(2) Examines emacspeak's internal voice table to see if this
speech style has a voice already defined.
If so it returns immediately.
Otherwise, it does the additional work of defining a dectalk-voice for
future use.
See module dectalk-voices.el to see how voices are defined.

@node amixer
@section amixer

Provide an emacs front-end to amixer,
the sound mixer in ALSA that is used to configure the audio device.

The main entry point is command @code{emacspeak-audio-setup} bound
to @kbd{C-e)}. When called for the first time, this command
builds up a database of available controls on the default audio
device. These control names are then available for completion in
the minibuffer. Pick a desired control, e.g., "master playback
volume", and this displays a prompt with the current value. Enter
the new value and press <RETURN>. To reset all controls to their
default values, Press @kbd{C-j}.

@subsection Amixer Commands

This module is Dectalk specific.

@subsection Dectalk-Voices Commands

@subsubsection dectalk
@deffn {Command} dectalk   
@table @kbd
@item C-e d C-d

@end defvar

@node dom-addons
@section dom-addons

Useful additional functions for dom.el

@node dtk-interp
@section dtk-interp

All requests to the speech server are factored out into
this module.
These calls are declared here as defun so they are
inlined by the byte compiler.
This  keeps the code efficient,
but gives us the flexibility to call out to different
speech servers.

@node dtk-speak
@section dtk-speak

Defines the TTS interface.
Here, prefix dtk is synonymous with tts.

@subsection Dtk-Speak Commands

@subsubsection dtk-add-cleanup-pattern
@deffn {Command} dtk-add-cleanup-pattern  (&optional delete)
@table @kbd
@item C-e d a
@kindex C-e d a
@item <fn> d a
@kindex <fn> d a
@end table

@findex dtk-add-cleanup-pattern

@format
Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that
are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes
this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed
by a repeat count instead of speaking all the characters
making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern ‘.’ (this is already added by default) emacspeak
will say ‘‘aw fifteen dot’’ when speaking the string
‘‘...............’’ instead of ‘‘period period period period
’’

@findex dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space

@format
Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
normal use.  However in modes such as ‘shell-mode’ and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear
infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
space makes emacspeak’s stop command responsive.  However,
when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

@section emacspeak

Emacspeak extends Emacs to be a fully functional audio desktop.
This is the main emacspeak module.
It actually does very little:
It sets up Emacs to load package-specific
Emacspeak modules as each package is loaded.
It implements function emacspeak which loads the rest of the system.

@subsection Emacspeak Commands

@subsubsection emacspeak
@deffn {Command} emacspeak   
@findex emacspeak

@format
Start the Emacspeak Audio Desktop.
Use Emacs as you normally would,
emacspeak will provide you spoken feedback as you work.  Emacspeak also
provides commands for having parts of the current buffer, the
mode-line etc to be spoken.

If you are hearing this description as a result of pressing
C-h C-e you may want to press C-e s to
stop speech, and then use the arrow keys to move around in the Help
buffer to read the rest of this description, which includes a summary
of all emacspeak keybindings.

All emacspeak commands use C-e as a prefix
key.  You can also set the state of the TTS engine by using
C-e d as a prefix.  Here is a summary of all
emacspeak commands along with their bindings.  You need to precede the
keystrokes listed below with C-e.

Emacspeak also provides a fluent speech extension to the Emacs
terminal emulator (eterm).  Note: You need to use the term package that
comes with emacs-19.29 and later.

@node emacspeak-advice
@section emacspeak-advice

This module defines the advice forms for making the core of Emacs speak
Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not belong here!
I violate this at present by advising completion comint and
shell here.

Note that we needed to advice a lot more for Emacs 19 and
Emacs 20 than we do for Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.
As of August 2007, this file is being purged of advice forms
not needed in Emacs 22.
This also means that this and subsequent versions of
Emacspeak should not be run on versions of Emacs older than
Emacs 21,
And preferably only run on Emacs 22.
This version of Emacspeak is only tested on Emacs 24 and later.

This module implements an Emacspeak Bookshare client.
@subsection  requirements
@itemize
@item You need to get your own API key
@item You need Emacs built with libxml2 support
@end itemize

@subsection Usage
The main entry point is command @code{emacspeak-bookshare} bound to @kbd{C-e C-b}.
This creates a special @emph{Bookshare Interaction} buffer that is
placed in @emph{emacspeak-bookshare-mode}.
Se the help for that mode on detailed usage instructions and key-bindings.

@subsection Sample Interaction

Assuming you have correctly setup your API key:
@itemize
@item Customize group @code{emacspeak-bookshare} by pressing @kbd{C-h G}.
@item  Press @kbd{C-e C-b} to open or switch to the Bookshare buffer.
@item Perform a search @kbd{a} or @kbd{t} for author or title search.
@item You will be prompted for your Bookshare password if this is
the first time.
@item The password will be saved to your configured
@code{auth-source} --- usually @code{~/.authinfo.gpg}.
You can also use @code{password-store[.]}
@item The results of the search appear in the Bookshare buffer.
Audio formatting and auditory icons convey if  a result is already available locally.
@item If not available locally, press @kbd{D} to download the content.
@item Press @kbd{U} to unpack the downloaded content.
@item Press @kbd{e} to  display the entire book.
@item Press @kbd{c} to display the table of contents.
@item Now, use all of EWW  @xref{emacspeak-eww} extensions  and profit!

@section emacspeak-chess

The Emacs Chess package provides a rich environment for playing and
exploring Chess Games.
That package comes with a light-weight module that announces
moves.

This module aims do do much more, including:
@itemize @bullet
@item Navigate the board along various axies with audio-formatted  output.
 @item Browse games via  rich audio-formatted   output.
@item Speech-enable all interactive commands  provided by the Chess
package.
@item Enable various means of exploring the state of game, perhaps with
a view to being able to spot patterns   from listening to the
output.
@end itemize
@subsection Navigating And Examining The Board
The board can be navigated along the 8 compass directions.
Arrow keys move to the appropriate squares on the board.
@kbd{/} and @kbd{\} move down the diagonals.
@kbd{[} and @kbd{]} move up the respective diagonals.
@itemize  @bullet
@item  Move North: @code{emacspeak-chess-north} bound to @kbd{up}.
@item  Move South: @code{emacspeak-chess-south} bound to
@kbd{down}.
@item  Move West: @code{emacspeak-chess-west} bound to @kbd{left}.
@item  Move East: @code{emacspeak-chess-east} bound to @kbd{right}.
@end itemize
You can also move along the diagonals:
@itemize @bullet
@item  Move Northwest: @code{emacspeak-chess-northwest} bound to
@kbd{[}.
@item  Move Northeast: @code{emacspeak-chess-northeast} bound to  @kbd{]}.
@item  Move Southwest: @code{emacspeak-chess-southwest} bound to
@kbd{/}.
@item  Move Southeast: @code{emacspeak-chess-southeast} bound to
@kbd{\}.
@end itemize
You can also jump to a given board position by:
@itemize @bullet
@item  Jump: @code{emacspeak-chess-jump} bound to @kbd{j}.
@item Target of last move: @code{emacspeak-chess-goto-target} bound to @kbd{t}.
@item Look: @code{emacspeak-chess-speak-that-square} bound to
@kbd{l}.
@item  Review   current square: @kbd{;}.
@item Review Board: @code{emacspeak-chess-speak-board} bound to
@kbd{z}. Useful in end-state.
@item Locate pieces: @code{emacspeak-chess-speak-piece-squares}
bound to @kbd{s}. Specify piece as a single char --- @kbd{w} speaks
all white pieces, @kbd{l} speaks all black pieces, use SAN notation
char for a specific piece.  Use @kbd{a} to hear entire board, this
last is most useful when the game is an end-state.
@item Discover who targets a square:
@code{emacspeak-chess-speak-who-targets} bound to @kbd{w}. Argument
@code{piece} is similar to the previously listed command.
@end itemize
You can obtain views of the board along the rows and diagonals, as
well as a @emph{knight's perspective }:
@itemize @bullet
@item Viewers: @kbd{v} followed by the directional navigation keys
speaks the squares in that direction from the current
square. @kbd{vn} speaks the squares from a knight's perspective,
i.e. the squares the Knight would see  from the current
position. similarly, @kbd{vk} speaks the non-empty squares seen by the King
from the current position.
@kbd{v} followed by a rank-or-file char speaks that complete rank
or file.
@end itemize
@subsection Examining Games

Package @emph{Chess} allows one to browse through a game using
@kbd{,} and @kbd{.}  --- @code{chess-display-move-backward} and
@code{chess-display-move-forward}.  Emacspeak speech-enables these
commands to speak the move that led to the currently displayed
state of the game. Finally, @kbd{m} speaks the @emph{current move}
being displayed.

@node emacspeak-ediff
@section emacspeak-ediff

Ediff provides a nice visual interface to diff. ;;;Comparing and
patching files is easy with ediff when you can see the screen.
This module provides Emacspeak extensions to work fluently
with ediff. Try it out, it's an excellent example of why
Emacspeak is better than a traditional screenreader. This module
was originally written to interface to the old ediff.el bundled
with GNU Emacs 19.28 and earlier. It has been updated to work
with the newer and much larger ediff system found in Emacs 19.29
and later.

When using under modern versions of Emacs, I recommend setting
(setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
so that Emacs always displays Ediff windows in a single frame.

@subsection Introduction

This module implements the Emacspeak EPub
Bookshelf --- a unified interface for organizing, locating and
reading EPub EBooks on the emacspeak Audio Desktop. The epub
reader is built using the Emacs Web Browser (EWW), and all of
emacspeak's EWW conveniences are available when reading EBooks ---
see @xref{emacspeak-eww} for useful tools including bookmarking
and structured navigation. For now it supports epub2 --- it will
support epub3 some time in the future.

The main entry point is command @command{emacspeak-epub} bound to
@kbd{C-e g}. This command opens a new bookshelf buffer unless the
user has previously opened a specific bookshelf. A
@emph{bookshelf} is a buffer that lists books placed on a given
bookshelf --- these are listed by @emph{title} and
@emph{author}. The bookshelf buffer is in a special mode that
provides single-key commands for adding, removing and finding
books, as well as for opening the selected book using Emacs'
built-in Web browser (@command{eww}).

The next few sections give a high-level overview of the emacspeak
Bookshelf and EPub interaction, followed by detailed documentation
on the various commands and user options.

@subsection Organizing EBooks On The Emacspeak Desktop

In the simplest case, EBooks can be placed under a specific
directory (with sub-directories as needed).
Customize   user option @code{emacspeak-epub-library-directory}
to point to this location.
Here is  a quick summary of commands for
organizing, saving and opening  a bookshelf:

@table @kbd
@item a
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-add-epub
@item b
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-open
@item c
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-clear
@item d
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-remove-this-book
@item r
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-rename
@item l
emacspeak-epub-locate-epubs
@item C-a
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-add-directory
@item C-d
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-remove-directory
@item C-l
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-redraw
@item C-o
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-open-epub
@item M-s
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-save
@item C-x C-q
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-refresh
@item C-x C-s
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-save
@end table

@subsection Integrating With Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg integration provides one-shot commands for downloading
the latest copy of the Gutenberg catalog and  finding and downloading
the desired epub for offline reading.

@table @kbd
@item C
emacspeak-epub-gutenberg-catalog
@item g
emacspeak-epub-gutenberg-download
@end table
Once downloaded, these EBooks can be
organized under  @code{emacspeak-epub-library-directory}
For  more advanced usage, see the next section
on integrating with Calibre catalogs.

@subsection Calibre Integration

Project Calibre  enables the indexing and searching of
large EBook collections.
Read the Calibre documentation for organizing and indexing your EBook library.
See user options named @code{emacspeak-epub-calibre-*} for
customizing  emacspeak to work with Calibre.
Once set up, Calibre integration provides
the following commands from the @emph{bookshelf} buffer:

@table @kbd
@item /
emacspeak-epub-calibre-results
@item A
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-calibre-author
@item S
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-calibre-search
@item T
emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-calibre-title
@end table

@subsection Reading EBooks From The Bookshelf

The most efficient means to read an EBook is to have EWW render
the entire book --- this works well even for very large EBooks
given that EWW is efficient at rendering HTML. Rendering the
entire book means that all of the contents are available for
searching. To view an EBook in its entirety, use command
@code{emacspeak-epub-eww}. You can open the EPub table of contents
with command @code{emacspeak-epub-open}; for a
well-constructed epub, this TOC should provide hyperlinks to each
section listed in the table of contents.

@table @kbd
@item RET
emacspeak-epub-eww
@item e
emacspeak-epub-eww
@item f
emacspeak-epub-browse-files
@item o
emacspeak-epub-open
@end table

EWW == Emacs Web Browser

EWW is a light-weight Web browser built into Emacs starting with
Emacs-24.4 . This module speech-enables EWW.

It implements additional interactive commands for navigating the
DOM. It also provides a set of filters for interactively filtering
the DOM by various attributes such as id, class and role.
Finally, this module updates EWW's built-in key-bindings with
Emacspeak conveniences.

@subsection EWW And EBooks On The Emacspeak Audio Desktop
Modules emacspeak-epub and emacspeak-bookshare provide EBook
front-ends to EPub-2 and Daisy EBooks. Both modules now use EWW to
render these EBooks. Module emacspeak-eww provides a simple
bookmarking facility --- called eww-marks (to avoid confusion with
EWW's Web Bookmarks). When reading an EBook, you can use @code{m}
to create an EWW-mark at that position. These marks are
automatically saved across Emacs sessions. To open a previously
created eww-mark, use command @code{emacspeak-eww-open-mark} bound
to @code{C-x r e}. This command reads a eww-mark name with
completion. Use this command with an interactive prefix arg to
delete a previously created eww-mark.

@node emacspeak-filtertext
@section emacspeak-filtertext

It is often useful  to view the results of filtering
large amounts of text.;;; Typically you do this with
various combinations of grep and friends.
When doing so it requires explicit effort to not destroy
the original text being filtered.
This module provides a textfilter utility that:
A) Copies over the selected text to a special filtertext
buffer
B) Implements a filtertext mode for that buffer that
allows easy application of filters
C: Provides commands for reverting to the original
unfiltered text
D: Provides commands for saving results from
intermediate filters.

@node emacspeak-gridtext
@section emacspeak-gridtext

Emacspeak's table browsing mode allows one to
efficiently access  content that is tabular in nature.
That module also provides functions for inferring table
structure where possible.
Often, such structure is hard to infer automatically
--but might be known to the user
e.g. treat columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table
and so on.
This module allows the user to specify a conceptual grid
that is "overlaid" on the region of text to turn it into
a table for tabular browsing. For now, elements of the
grid are "one line" high --but that may change in the
future if necessary. This module is useful for browsing
structured text files and the output from programs that
tabulate their output.
It's also useful for handling multicolumn text.
The "grid" is specified as a list of (start end) tuples..

@node emacspeak-ispell
@section emacspeak-ispell

This module speech enables ispell.
Implementation note: This is hard because of how  ispell.el is written
Namely, all of the work is done by one huge hairy function.
This makes advising it hard.
The ispell commands work well with Emacspeak as long as the list of correction choices are few.
For interactively moving through corrections, install package flyspell-correct from MELPA
(package-install "flyspell-correct")
Then use M-x flyspell-mode.
Package flyspell is speech-enabled by Emacspeak module emacspeak-flyspell
And that module sets up flyspell-correct to use IDO-style completion,
i.e. you can move through corrections with C-r and C-s.

LISPY ==  smart Navigation Of Lisp code
This module speech-enables lispy.
 @subsection Overview
Lispy editing keeps delimiters balanced and Lispy navigators
reliably place point on either the opening or closing delimiter of
the current s-expression. Emacspeak leverages this fact in the
type of spoken feedback that is produced. All navigation commands  produce the following:
@itemize
@item  Speak the current s-expression when at the front of a sexp.
@item  Speak the current line with option @code{emacspeak-show-point}
turned on when at the end of an s-expression.
@item  Produce auditory icon @code{left} or @code{right} to indicate point being at the beginning or end of current line.
@item Indicate with an auditory icon if point did not move.

@node emacspeak-m-player
@section emacspeak-m-player

Defines an Emacspeak front-end for interacting with @code{mplayer}.
Program @code{mplayer}  is a versatile media player capable of playing many
streaming media formats.
This module provides complete access to all @code{mplayer} functionality
from a convenient Emacs interface.

@subsection Usage

The main entry-point is command @code{emacspeak-multimedia}
bound to @kbd{C-e ;}.
This prompts for and launches the desired media stream.
Once a stream is playing, you can control it with single-letter keystrokes
in the @code{*M-Player*} buffer.
Alternatively, you can switch away from that buffer to do real work,
And invoke @code{m-player} commands by  first pressing @kbd{C-e ;}.
As an example, pressing @kbd{v} in the @code{*M-Player*} buffer
prompts for and sets the volume;
When not in the @code{*M-Player*} buffer, you can achieve the same
by pressing @kbd{C-e ; v}.
Press @kbd{C-h b} in the @code{*M-Player*}
buffer  to list  @code{m-player} keybindings.

@node emacspeak-maths
@section emacspeak-maths

@subsection Setup
Do not try what follows until you have read  js/node/README.org
and successfully set up nvm (Node Version Manager) as described there.
@subsection Technical Overview
Spoken mathematics on the emacspeak audio desktop. Use a NodeJS
based speech-rule-engine for Mathematics as the backend for
processing mathematical markup. The result of this processing is
an annotated S-expression that is rendered via Emacspeak's speech
facilities. Annotations follow Aural CSS as implemented in
Emacspeak, This allows us to map these expressions to aural
properties supported by specific TTS engines.
@subsection Basic Usage:

Start  the server/client: M-x emacspeak-maths-start. Once the server
and client are started, you can browse any number of math
expressions using the emacspeak-maths-navigator described below.
Note: In general, once everything is configured correctly, using
the maths navigator automatically starts the server and
client. Invoke the Navigator using s-spc --- this is the <windows>
key on
Linux. Now you can use these keys:
@itemize
@item  Show Output <o> Switch to output buffer and quit Maths Navigator
@item Enter: <SPC>
Enter a LaTeX expression.
@item Smart-Enter: <enter> Enter the guessed expression with no prompting.
@item Alt-Text <a> Process alt-text
under point as LaTeX.
@item Down <down> Move down a level.
@item
Up <up> Move up a level.
@item Left <left> Move left.
@item Right
<right> Move right.
@item Exit <any other key> Exit
navigator.

@end itemize
The current expression is spoken after
each of the above commands. It is also displayed in a special
buffer *Spoken Math*. That buffer holds all previously generated
output, And Emacs commands forward-page and backward-page can be
used to move through each chunk of output.

MUGGLES ==  Emacspeak spells for power-users.
This module implements no new functionality --- contrast with
emacspeak-wizards.  Instead, it uses package hydra to provide
convenience key-bindings that access existing Emacspeak
functionality.
You need to install package Hydra first:
@samp{M-x package-install  hydra}.

Note that on newer versions of Emacs, loading this module will
attempt to automatically install package hydra if it is not found.
@subsection Using Hydras
See the high-level documentation for the Hydra package by executing
@kbd {C-h C-j } hydra @kbd{RET}.
The documentation in this section uses the same terminology as
shown in the hydra package documentation.

@subsection Implemented Muggles

@itemize
@item Brightness: @kbd{print} Control display brightness using xbacklight.
@item View-Mode: @kbd{C-. v} Temporarily behave like view-mode.
@item Navigate: @kbd{s-n} Navigate with ease.
@item  org-mode structure nav: @kbd{C-c C-SPC} Structure navigation  for org-mode.
@item  org-mode tables: @kbd{C-c t} Table UI for org-mode tables.
@item m-player: @kbd{s-m} Emacspeak-M-Player Commands
@item m-player: @kbd{s-;} Emacspeak-M-Player muggle
@item pianobar: @kbd{s-'} Emacspeak-M-pianobar Commands
@item hideshow: C-, h Provide HideShow bindings.
@item origami: C-, / Origami   bindings.
@item toggle-option:  @kbd{C-c o} Single binding for toggling options.
@item outliner: <C-c .> Bindings from outline-minor-mode.
@item Info-Summary: <?> in Info Info Summary Muggle
@item Repeatable-Yank: @kbd{C-y} Smart yank
@item SmartParens: @kbd{C-c ,} Smart Parens
@item Vuiet Explorer: @kbd{C-; v} Vuiet Music Explorer and Player
@end itemize

Emacspeak automatically speaks Hydra hints when displayed.
To silence all Hydra hints, set hydra-is-helpful to nil.  To
temporarily silence speaking of Hydra hints, Muggles can bind
command @code{emacspeak-hydra-toggle-talkative}.  As an
example, Muggle @samp{ViewMode} binds @code{s} to this command.

@section emacspeak-ocr

This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR.
This module assumes that sane is installed and working
for image acquisition,
and that there is an OCR engine that can take acquired
images and produce text.
Prerequisites:
Sane installed and working.
scanimage to generate tiff files from scanner.
tiffcp to compress the tiff file.
working ocr executable
by default this module assumes that the OCR executable
is named "ocr"

@findex emacspeak-ocr

@format
An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.  

Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
suitable for browsing the results.

For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
‘?’ to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

@subsubsection emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image   
@findex emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image

@format
Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.
Useful if you’ve scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that does not automatically flip the image for you.
You need the imagemagik family of tools --- we use mogrify to transform the image.
Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the expected
‘current page’ is not found.
@end format
@end deffn

@subsubsection emacspeak-ocr-forward-page
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-forward-page  (&optional count-ignored)
@findex emacspeak-ocr-forward-page

(fn &optional COUNT-IGNORED)
@end format
@end deffn

@subsubsection emacspeak-ocr-mode
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-mode   
@findex emacspeak-ocr-mode

@format
 An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

2) An OCR engine.

1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
tiff file.  Then set variable
emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to ‘scanimage’ which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.

By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to ‘tiffcp’ by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.

2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
available as /usr/bin/ocr.

Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.

The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.  

This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the key-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

By default, the document being scanned is named ‘untitled’.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.

Implementation Notes From 2018:
After 3 years, variable emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces has
been removed,
and the advice on put-text-property and friends removed.
This module nowlimits itself to mapping face/font-lock properties
from overlays to the associated text-property (personality).
This mapping is done via emacspeak-personality-add.
The options for cumulative personalities have been removed.

Implementation Notes From 2015:

Setting emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces to
nil  now results in dtk-speak falling back to the
face->voice mapping defined via voice-setup for the face at
point. What this means:

1. You always get voice-locking except
when you set voice-lock-mode to nil.

2. The advice on
put-text-property and friends become a no-op and we still get
voice-locking.

3. Eventually this will become the default behavior
for voice-locking.

Implementation Notes from 2002.

This module defines a personality interface for implementing voice
lock via font lock.

@subsection PIANOBAR ==  Pandora Client for Emacs
pianobar git://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install pianobar

Pianobar Is a stand-alone client for Pandora Radio. pianobar.el
available on the Emacs Wiki at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pianobar.el Provides access to
Pandora Radio via pianobar from the comfort of Emacs. This module
speech-enables Pianobar and enhances it for the Complete Audio
Desktop.

@subsection Emacspeak Usage:

Emacspeak implements command emacspeak-pianobar, a light-weight
wrapper on top of pianobar. Emacspeak binds this command to
@code{C-e '}. In my personal @code{.emacs}, I bind this to
@code{f5}. Command emacspeak-pianobar is designed to let you
launch Pandora channels and switch tracks/channels without moving
away from your primary tasks such as editting code or
reading/composing email. Toward this end, launching command
emacspeak-pianobar the first time initializes the
@code{*pianobar*} buffer and launches command @code{pianobar};
Focus is placed in the @code{*pianobar*} buffer. Pianobar can be
controlled with single keystrokes while in this buffer. The most
useful keys are @code{right} for skipping tracks, @code{up} and
@code{down} for switching channels etc.; see the keys bound in
@code{pianobar-key-map} for a complete list. Pressing @code{C-e '}
in  the @code{*pianobar*} buffer  buries the
@code{*pianobar*}. From here on, Pianobar can be controlled
by pressing the Pianobar prefix key (@code{C-e '}) followed by
keys from @code{pianobar-key-map}.

@node emacspeak-pronounce
@section emacspeak-pronounce

This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries
for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per
directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a persistent
user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest
of emacspeak in using the dictionary.
Algorithm:

The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values
are association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module
can retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association
lists for a given file.

@node emacspeak-sounds
@section emacspeak-sounds

This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in emacspeak.
Design goal:
1) Auditory icons should be used to provide additional feedback,
not as a gimmick.
2) The interface should be usable at all times without the icons:
e.g. when on a machine without a sound card.
3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice,
We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that something was selected with a sound cue.
 This interface will assume the availability of a shell command "play"
that can take one or more sound files and play them.
This module will also provide a mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes
architecture for  auditory icons.
Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory

@subsubsection emacspeak-table-mode
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-table-mode   
@findex emacspeak-table-mode

@format
Major mode for browsing tables.
Table mode is designed to allow speech users to browse tabular data
with full contextual feedback while retaining all the power of the
two-dimensional spatial layout of tables.

In table mode, the arrow keys move between cells of the table.
Emacspeak speaks the cell contents in a user-customizable way.  The
visual display is kept in sync with the speech you hear; however
Emacspeak is examining the entire table in order to speak the current
cell content intelligently.

You can interactively specify that emacspeak should speak either the row or
column header (or both) while speaking each cell.  You can also specify a row
or column filter that should be applied when speaking entire rows or columns
--this lets you view slices of a table.  You can move to a specific row or
column by searching the cell contents or by searching the row or column
headers to locate items of interest.

Here is a short description of the special commands provided in this mode.

The next four commands help you move to the edges of the table:

E               emacspeak-table-goto-right
A               emacspeak-table-goto-left
B               emacspeak-table-goto-bottom
T               emacspeak-table-goto-top

The next two commands let you search the table.
The commands ask you if you want to search rows or columns.
When searching headers remember that row 0 is the column header, and that column 0 is the row header.

h               emacspeak-table-search-headers
s               emacspeak-table-search

The next command lets you specify how cell contents should be spoken.  Specify
one of: ‘b’ for both, ‘c’ for column, ‘r’ for row, ‘f’ for row filtering and
‘g’ for column filtering. --table cells with then be spoken with both (or
either)row and column headers, or with the filter applied.

a               emacspeak-table-select-automatic-speaking-method

The next set of commands speak the current table cell:

.               emacspeak-table-speak-coordinates
b               emacspeak-table-speak-both-headers-and-element
SPC             emacspeak-table-speak-current-element
c               emacspeak-table-speak-column-header-and-element
r               e macspeak-table-speak-row-header-and-element

The next set of commands navigate the table:

right               emacspeak-table-next-column
left               emacspeak-table-previous-column
down               emacspeak-table-next-row
up               emacspeak-table-previous-row
j               emacspeak-table-goto
S-tab               emacspeak-table-previous-column
TAB               emacspeak-table-next-column

Row and Column Filtering

Filtering is designed to let you view slices of a table.
They are specified as lists of numbers and strings.
The concept is best explained with an example.

A row filter specifies which of the entries in the current row should be
spoken.Entries are numbered starting with 0.  Thus, when working with a table
having 8 columns, a row filter of (1 2 3) will speak only entries 1 2 and 3.
Use the sample tables in etc/tables   to familiarize yourself with this
feature. Note that you can intersperse meaningful strings in the list that
specifies the filter.

@section emacspeak-transient

TRANSIENT ==  Transient commands --- used by magit and friends.
This module speech-enables transient.

@subsection Introduction

Package Transient is similar to package Hydra in the sense that it can
be used to create a sequence of chained/hierarchical commands that are
invoked via a sequence of keys. It is used by Magit for dispatching to
the various Git commands.
Speech-enabling package Transient results in the various interactive
commands producing auditory feedback. Transient
shows an ephemeral window with the currently available commands,
Emacspeak speech-enables transient--show to speak that content.

Finally, this module defines a new minor mode called
transient-emacspeak  that  enables  interactive browsing of the
contents displayed temporarily. Note that without this
functionality, learning complex packages like Magit would be difficult
because  the list of available commands (potentially very long) gets
spoken in its entirety by the advice on transient--show.

@subsection Browsing Contents Of transient--show

When executing a command defined via Transient --- e.g. command
Magit-dispatch and friends, press @kbd {C-z} (transient-suspend) to
temporarily suspend   the currently active transient. Emacspeak now
displays a  *transient-emacspeak* buffer that displays the contents of the
most recently displayed transient choices. Pressing @kbd {C-c} resumes
the transient; Pressing @kbd{C-q} quits the transient.

@subsection Emacspeak-Transient Commands

@subsubsection emacspeak-transient-mode
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-transient-mode   
@findex emacspeak-transient-mode

this mode runs the hook ‘emacspeak-transient-mode-hook’, as the final or penultimate step
during initialization.

@format
Switch to shell buffer by key. This provides a predictable
  means for switching to a specific shell buffer. When invoked
  from a non-shell-mode buffer that is a dired-buffer or is
  visiting a file, invokes ‘cd ’ in the shell to change to the
  value of ‘default-directory’ --- if called with a
  prefix-arg. When already in a shell buffer, interactive prefix
  arg ‘prefix’ causes this shell to be re-keyed if appropriate
  --- see M-x emacspeak-wizards-shell-re-key for an explanation
  of how re-keying works.

@node soundscape
@section soundscape

Soundscapes @url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape}
define an acoustic environment.
Boodler  at @url{http://boodler.org} is a
Python-based SoundScape generator.
To use this module, first install boodler.
Then install the soundscape packages (*.boop) files available
at @url{http://boodler.org/lib}.
Make sure boodler works and produces audio in your environment.
finally install the Boodler packages  from
emacspeak/scapes from the Emacspeak GitHub repository by running
@code{cd emacspeak/scapes; make }

When  boodler is set up and all packages installed, copy
file emacspeak/scapes/soundscapes  to ~/.boodler/Collection.
The above file lists all installed SoundScapes.
Directory emacspeak/scapes also contains
additional Boodler Agents and SoundScapes  that
I have created for use with Emacspeak.

 Module soundscape.el  defines Emacs conveniences for running
Soundscapes. Main Entry Points:

@itemize
@item M-x soundscape-toggle -- Enables or
disables automatic SoundScapes.
@item M-x soundscape --
runs a named SoundScape
@item M-x soundscape-stop -- Stops a specified running Soundscape.
@item M-x soundscape-kill -- Kills all running Soundscapes.
@end itemize

When automatic Soundscapes are enabled, SoundScapes are
 started and stopped based on the current major
mode. Active Soundscape  are displayed as part of the minor-mode-alist.
Command emacspeak-speak-minor-mode-line can be used to have this spoken.

Thus, SoundScapes can be thought of as reflecting the
@emph{mood} of the current @emph{mode}.
This package defines a single @var{soundscape-default-theme}
that is loaded using @code{(soundscape-load soundscape-default-theme)}.
Emacs modes that provide similar functionality e.g.,
communication == email, IM, ... map to  the same @emph{mood}.

@node sox
@section sox

This module defines a convenient speech-enabled

support to sox, do

sudo apt-get libsox-fmt-mp3 install

This module provides support for ladspa effects using module ladspa.el.

is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is
presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the
auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones
presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in
this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of
10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure
tones presented to each ear. For more details, see
@url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats}.

This module implements a set of user-facing commands for generating
binaural beats. The commands are organized from high-level commands that
play predefined binaural beats to lower-level commands that can be
used to create new effect sequences.

All binaural beat sequences are played with a relatively low gain
--- they are designed to be heard in the background and when
effective blend fully into the background. You can increase the
overall volume of all binaural beat sequences by customizing
@defvar {User Option} sox-binaural-gain-offset to a positive value
@end defvar
--- default is 0.

@subsubsection High-Level Commands For Pre-Defined Binaural Beats

These commands can be called directly to play one of the predefined
binaural beats.

@itemize
@item @command{sox-rev-up}: A set of binaural beats designed for  use
at the start of the day. Transitions from @emph{Dream} -> @emph{Think}
->@emph{Act} -> @emph{Focus}.
@item @command{sox-wind-down}: A  set of binaural beats for winding down
at the end of the day. This can be thought of as the reverse of
@command{sox-rev-up} and the sequence transitions from @emph{Act} ->
@emph{Think} -> @emph{Dream} ->@emph{Sleep}.
@item @command{sox-turn-down}: Designed for falling asleep.
This sequence starts with a short period of @emph{Dream} before moving
to @emph{Sleep}.
@item @command{sox-relax}:  A variant of the previous sequence,
@code{sox-relax} spends equal time in @emph{Dream} and @emph{Sleep}.
@item @command{sox-binaural}: Provide a completion-based front-end to
playing any one of the predefined binaural effects (@emph{Delta},
@emph{Theta}, @emph{Alpha}, @emph{Beta}, or @emph{Gamma}. The previously
defined sequences are built up using these effects.
@item @command{sox-beats-binaural}: Plays a collection of binaural
beats, prompting for carrier and beat frequencies for each tone. The
predefined sequences listed earlier were created after first generating
experimental beat-sequences using this command.
@item @command{sox-slide-binaural}: Prompts for two binaural effects
(see above) and generates a binaural beat that @emph{slides} from the
first effect to the second over a specified duration.
@item @command{sox-chakras}: Pick  amongst one of a predefined set of
sequences designed for @emph{Chakra} meditation.
@item @command{sox-tone-binaural}: Generate a simple binaural beat
with a single carrier frequency.
@item @command{sox-tone-slide-binaural}: Generate a  tone that slides
from one binaural beat to another.

@section toy-braille

This is a bit of toy code to write in braille.
To try this, load this file (`M-x load-file path/to/toy-braille.el'), then do:

M-: (get-toy-braille-string "just a test")

That's just a toy, meant as an excuse and maybe a tool to learn a
bit of braille, nothing more.

Unicode fonts are needed.

You can try:

M-: (set-default-font "-*-unifont-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")

or

M-: (set-default-font "-*-clearlyu-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-*")

(it will only work if the relative font is installed and properly configured).

@node voice-setup
@section voice-setup

A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display.

Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
documentation strings in another, and so on.

Comments will be spoken in `voice-comment-personality'.
Strings will be spoken in `voice-string-personality'.
Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
spoken in `voice-function-name-personality'.
Reserved words will be spoken in `voice-keyword-personality'.

To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
updated with every insertion or deletion.

How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set
of voice names.  This module maps standard "personality"
names to these pre-defined voices.  It does this via special
form def-voice-font which takes a personality name, a voice
name and a face name to set up the mapping between face and
personality, and personality and voice.
Newer Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when
defining face->personality mappings.
Older code calls def-voice-font directly, but over time those
calls will be changed to the more succinct form provided by
voice-setup-add-map. For use from other modules, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a
single face.
Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call
special form def-voice-font.

Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to
be available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS
style specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined
via defvoice can be customized via custom see the
documentation for defvoice.
