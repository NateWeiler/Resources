@section Turning Twenty 

One afternoon in the third week of September 1994, I started
writing myself a small Emacs extension using Lisp Advice to make
Emacs speak to me so I could use a Linux laptop. As Emacspeak
turns twenty, this article is both a quick look back over the
twenty years of lessons learned, as well as a glimpse into what
might be possible as we evolve to a world of connected,
ubiquitous computing. This article draws on @url{http://norvig.com/21-days.html,Learning To Program
In 10 Years} by Peter Norvig for some of its inspiration.

@node Using UNIX With Speech Output  ---  1994
@section Using UNIX With Speech Output  ---   1994

As a graduate student at @url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/raman.html,Cornell}, I accessed my Unix workstation
(SunOS) from an Intel 486 PC running IBM Screen-Reader. There
 was no means of directly using a UNIX box at the time; after
 graduating, I continued doing the same for about six months at
 Digital Research in Cambridge  ---  the only difference being that
 my desktop workstation was now a DEC-Alpha. Throughout this
 time, Emacs was my environment of choice for everything from
 software development and Internet access to writing documents.


In fall of 1994, I wanted to start using a laptop running Linux;
a colleague (Dave Wecker) was retiring his 386mhz laptop that
already had Linux on it and I decided to inherit it. But there
was only one problem  ---  until then I had always accessed a UNIX
machine from a secondary PC running a screen-reader  ---  something
that would clearly make no sense with a laptop!

Another colleague, Win Treese, had pointed out the interesting
possibilities presented by package @strong{advice} in Emacs 19.23  ---  a
few weeks earlier, he had sent around a small snippet of code
that magically modified Emacs' version-control primitive to first
create an @emph{RCS} directory if none existed before adding a file to
version control. When I speculated about using the Linux laptop,
Dave remarked  ---  you live in Emacs anyway  ---  why dont you just make
it talk!

Connecting the dots, I decided to write myself a tool that
augmented Emacs' default behavior to @emph{speak}  ---  within about 4
hours, version 0.01 of Emacspeak was up and running.

@node Key Enabler  ---  Emacs And Lisp Advice
@section Key Enabler  ---  Emacs And Lisp Advice

It took me a couple of weeks to fully recognize the potential of
what I had built with Emacs Lisp Advice. Until then, I had used
screen-readers to listen to the contents of the visual display  --- 
but Lisp Advice let me do a lot more  ---  it enabled Emacspeak to
generate highly context-specific spoken feedback, augmented by a
set of auditory icons. I later formalized this design under the
name @url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-voicing,speech-enabled applications}. For a detailed overview of the
architecture of Emacspeak, see the @url{http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/publish-emacspeak-bc.html,chapter on Emacspeak} in the
book @url{http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/07/emacspeak-and-beautiful-code.html,Beautiful Code} from O'Reilly.

@node Key Component  ---  Text To Speech (TTS)
@section Key Component  ---   Text To Speech (TTS)

Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an
external Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech. In 1994,
Digital Equipment released what would turn out to be the last in
the line of hardware DECTalk synthesizers, the DECTalk
Express. This was essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash
memory that ran a version of the DECTalk TTS software  ---  to date,
it still remains my favorite Text-To-Speech engine. At the time,
I also had a software version of the same engine running on my
DEC-Alpha workstation; the desire to use either a software or
hardware solution to produce speech output defined the Emacspeak
speech-server architecture.

I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM releasing
a version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under the name
@emph{ViaVoice Outloud}. My colleague Jeffrey Sorenson implemented an
early version of the Emacspeak speech-server for this engine
using the OSS API; I later updated it to use the ALSA library
while on a flight back to SFO from Boston in 2001. That is still
the TTS engine that is speaking as I type this article on my
laptop.

20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux; the
best available solution in terms of quality continues to be the
Linux port of Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe for a
small price. Looking back across 20 years, the state of TTS on
Linux in particular and across all platforms in general continues
to be a disappointment; most of today's newer TTS engines are
geared toward mainstream use-cases where @emph{naturalness} of the
voice tends to supersede intelligibility at higher
speech-rates. Ironically, modern TTS engines also give
applications far less control over the generated output  ---  as a
case in point, I implemented
@url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html,Audio System For Technical Readings (AsTeR)} in 1994 using the
DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented @url{http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/,MathML support} in
@url{http://www.chromevox.com/,ChromeVox} using Google TTS. In 2013, it turned out to be
difficult or impossible to implement the type of audio renderings
that were possible with the admittedly less-natural sounding
DECTalk!

@node Emacspeak And Software Development
@section Emacspeak And Software Development

Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM Screen-Reader on
a PC with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX workstation. But
in about 2 weeks, Emacspeak was already a better environment for
developing Emacspeak in particular and software development in
general. Here are a few highlights in 1994 that made Emacspeak a
good software development environment, present-day users of
Emacspeak will see that that was just scratching the surface.

@itemize
@item
Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
highlighting.
@item
Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient feedback.
@item
Emacs' ability to navigate code structurally    ---  
@end itemize
as opposed to moving around by plain-text units such as
  characters, lines and words. S-Expressions are a major win!
@itemize
@item
Emacs' ability to specialize behavior based on major and
minor modes.
@item
Ability to browse program code using  tags, and getting
fluent spoken feedback.
@item
Completion @strong{everywhere}.
@item
Everything is searchable    ---    this is a huge win when you
cannot see the screen.
@item
Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous
spoken feedback augmented by aural highlights.
@item
Running code compilation  and being able to jump to errors
with spoken feedback.
@item
Ability to move through diff chunks when working with source
code and source control systems; refined diffs as provided by
the @strong{ediff} package when speech-enabled is a major
productivity win.
@item
Ability to easily move between email, document authoring and
programming  ---  though this may appear trivial, it continues to
be one of Emacs' biggest wins.
@end itemize


Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as being
among the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs  ---  there is
little that is Emacspeak specific in the above list  ---  except that
Emacspeak was able to provide fluent, well-integrated contextual
feedback for all of these tasks. And that was a game-changer
given what I had had before Emacspeak. As a case in point, I did
not dare program in Python before I speech-enabled Emacs'
Python-Mode; the fact that white space is significant in Python
made it difficult to program using a plain screen-reader that was
unaware of the semantics of the underlying content being
accessed.

@node Programming Defensively
@subsection Programming Defensively

As an aside, note that all of Emacspeak has been developed over
the last 20 years with Emacspeak being the only adaptive
technology on my system. This has led to  some interesting design
consequences, primary among them being  a strong education in
@strong{programming defensively}.  Here are some other key features of
the Emacspeak code-base:

@enumerate
@item
The code-base is extremely @strong{bushy} rather than deeply
hierarchical  ---  this means that when a module breaks, it does
not affect the rest of the system.
@item
Separation of concerns with respect to the various layers, a
tightly knit  core speech library  interfaces  with  any one
of many  speech servers  running as an external process.
@item
Audio formatting is abstracted by using the formalism
defined in Aural CSS.
@item
Emacspeak integrates with Emacs' user interface conventions
by taking over a single prefix key @strong{C-e} with @emph{all}
Emacspeak commands accessed through that single keymap.
This helps embedding Emacspeak functionality into a large
variety of third party modules without any loss of functionality.

@node Emacspeak And Authoring Documents
@section Emacspeak And Authoring Documents

In 1994, my preferred environment for authoring @strong{all} documents
was @strong{@LaTeX{}} using the Auctex package. Later I started writing
either @LaTeX{} or HTML using the appropriate support modes; today I
use @strong{org-mode} to do most of my content authoring. Personally, I
have never been a fan of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)
authoring tools  ---  in my experience that places an undue burden on
the author by drawing attention away from the content to focus on
the final appearance. An added benefit of creating content in
Emacs in the form of light-weight markup is that the content is
long-lived  ---  I can still usefully process and re-use things I
have written 25 years ago.

Emacs, with Emacspeak providing audio formatting and
context-specific feedback remains my environment of choice for
writing all forms of content ranging from simple email messages
to polished documents for print publishing. And it is worth
repeating that I @strong{never} need to focus on what the content is
going to look like  ---  that job is best left to the computer.

As an example of producing high-fidelity visual content, see this
write-up on
@url{http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/polyhedra/,Polyhedral
Geometry} that I published in 2002; all of the content,
including the drawings were created by me using Emacs.

@node Emacspeak And The Early Days Of The Web
@section Emacspeak And The Early Days Of The Web

Right around the time that I was writing version 0.01 of
emacspeak, a far more significant software movement was under way
 ---  the World Wide Web was moving from the realms of academia to
the mainstream world with the launch of NCSA Mosaic  ---  and in late
1994 by the first commercial Web browser in Netscape
Navigator. Emacs had always enabled integrated access to FTP
archives via package @emph{ange-ftp}; in late 1993, William Perry
released Emacs-W3, a Web browser for Emacs written entirely in
Emacs Lisp. W3 was one of the first large packages to be
speech-enabled by Emacspeak  ---  later it was the browser on which I
implemented the first draft of the
@url{http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html,Aural CSS
specification}. Emacs-W3 enabled many early innovations in the
context of providing non-visual access to Web content, including
audio formatting and structured content navigation; in summer of
1995, Dave Raggett and I outlined a few extensions to HTML Forms,
including the @strong{label} element as a means of associating metadata
with interactive form controls in HTML, and many of these ideas
were prototyped in Emacs-W3 at the time. Over the years, Emacs-W3
fell behind the times  ---  especially as the Web moved away from
cleanly structured HTML to a massive soup of unmatched tags. This
made parsing and error-correcting badly-formed HTML markup
expensive to do in Emacs-Lisp  ---  and performance suffered. To add
to this, mainstream users moved away because Emacs' rendering
engine at the time was not rich enough to provide the type of
visual renderings that users had come to expect. The advent of
DHTML, and JavaScript based Web Applications finally killed off
Emacs-W3 as far as most Emacs users were concerned.

But Emacs-W3 went through a revival on the emacspeak audio
desktop in late 1999 with the arrival of XSLT, and Daniel
Veillard's excellent implementation via the @strong{libxml2} and
@strong{libxslt} packages. With these in hand, Emacspeak was able to
hand-off the bulk of HTML error correction to the @strong{xsltproc}
tool. The lack of visual fidelity didn't matter much for an
eyes-free environment; so Emacs-W3 continued to be a useful tool
for consuming large amounts of Web content that did not require
JavaScript support.

During the last 24 months, @strong{libxml2} has been built into Emacs;
this means that you can now parse arbitrary HTML as found in the
wild without incurring a performance hit. This functionality was
leveraged first by package @strong{shr} (Simple HTML Renderer) within
the @strong{gnus} package for rendering HTML email. Later, the author of
@strong{gnus} and @strong{shr} created a new light-weight HTML viewer called
@strong{eww} that is now part of Emacs 24. With improved support for
variable pitch fonts and image embedding, Emacs is once again
able to provide visual renderings for a large proportion of
text-heavy Web content where it becomes useful for mainstream
Emacs users to view at least some Web content within Emacs;
during the last year, I have added support within emacspeak to
@url{http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2014/05/emacspeak-eww-updates-for-complete.html,extend package @strong{eww}} with support for DOM filtering and quick
content navigation.

@node Audio Formatting  ---  Generalizing Aural CSS
@section Audio Formatting  ---   Generalizing Aural CSS

A key idea in Audio System For Technical Readings @url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html,(AsTeR)} was the
use of various voice properties in combination with non-speech
auditory icons to create rich aural renderings. When I
implemented Emacspeak, I brought over the notion of audio
formatting to all buffers in Emacs by creating a @strong{voice-lock}
module that paralleled Emacs' @strong{font-lock} module. The visual
medium is far richer in terms of available fonts and colors as
compared to voice parameters available on TTS engines  --- 
consequently, it did not make sense to directly map Emacs' @strong{face}
properties to voice parameters. To aid in projecting visual
formatting onto auditory space, I created property @strong{personality}
analogous to Emacs' @strong{face} property that could be applied to
content displayed in Emacs; module @strong{voice-lock} applied that
property appropriately, and the Emacspeak core handled the
details of mapping personality values to the underlying TTS
engine.

The values used in property @strong{personality} were abstract, i.e.,
they were independent of any given speech engine. Later in the
fall of 1995, I re-expressed these set of abstract voice
properties in terms of Aural CSS; the work was published as a
first draft toward the end of 1995, and implemented in Emacs-W3
in early 1996. Aural CSS was an appendix in the CSS-1.0
specification; later, it graduated to being its own module within
CSS-2.0.

Later in 1996, all of Emacs' @strong{voice-lock} functionality was
re-implemented in terms of Aural CSS; the implementation has
stood the test of time in that as I added support for more TTS
engines, I was able to implement engine-specific mappings of
Aural-CSS values. This meant that the rest of Emacspeak could
define various types of voices for use in specific contexts
without having to worry about individual TTS
engines. Conceptually, property @strong{personality} can be thought of
as holding an @strong{aural display list}  ---  various parts of the system
can annotate pieces of text with relevant properties that finally
get rendered in the aggregate. This model also works well with
the notion of Emacs overlays where a moving overlay is used to
temporarily highlight text that has other context-specific
properties applied to it.


Audio formatting as implemented in Emacspeak is extremely
effective when working with all types of content ranging from
richly structured mark-up documents (@LaTeX{}, org-mode) and
formatted Web pages to program source code. Perceptually,
switching to audio formatted output feels like switching from a
black-and-white monitor to a rich color display. Today,
Emacspeak's audio formatted output is the only way I can
correctly write @strong{else if} vs @strong{elsif} in various programming
languages!

@node Conversational Gestures For The Audio Desktop
@section Conversational Gestures For The Audio Desktop

By 1996, Emacspeak was the only piece of adaptive technology I
used; in fall of 1995, I had moved to Adobe Systems from DEC
Research to focus on enhancing the Portable Document Format (PDF)
to make PDF content repurposable. Between 1996 and 1998, I was
primarily focused on electronic document formats  ---  I took this
opportunity to step back and evaluate what I had built as an
auditory interface within Emacspeak. This retrospect proved
extremely useful in gaining a sense of perspective and led to
formalizing the high-level concept of @emph{Conversational Gestures}
and structured browsing/searching as a means of thinking about
user interfaces.

By now, Emacspeak was a complete environment  ---  I formalized what
it provided under the moniker @emph{Complete Audio Desktop}. The fully
integrated user experience allowed me to move forward with
respect to defining interaction models that were highly optimized
to eyes-free interaction  ---  as an example, see how Emacspeak
interfaces with modes like @strong{dired} (Directory Editor) for
browsing and manipulating the filesystem, or @strong{proced} (Process
Editor) for browsing and manipulating running processes. Emacs'
integration with @strong{ispell} for spell checking, as well as its
various completion facilities ranging from minibuffer completion
to other forms of dynamic completion while typing text provided
more opportunities for creating innovative forms of eyes-free
interaction. With respect to what had gone before (and is still
par for the course as far as traditional screen-readers are
concerned), these types of highly dynamic interfaces present a
challenge. For example, consider handling a completion interface
using a screen-reader that is speaking the visual display. There
is a significant challenge in deciding @emph{what to speak} e.g., when
presented with a list of completions, the currently typed text,
and the default completion, which of these should you speak, and
in what order? The problem gets harder when you consider that the
underlying semantics of these items is generally not available
from examining the visual presentation in a consistent manner. By
having direct access to the underlying information being
presented, Emacspeak had a leg up with respect to addressing the
higher-level question  ---  when you do have access to this
information, how do you present it effectively in an eyes-free
environment? For this and many other cases of dynamic
interaction, a combination of audio formatting, auditory icons,
and the ability to synthesize succinct messages from a
combination of information items  ---  rather than having to forcibly
speak each item as it is rendered visually provided for highly
efficient eyes-free interaction.


This was also when I stepped back to build out Emacspeak's table
browsing facilities  ---  see the online Emacspeak documentation for
details on Emacspeak's table browsing functionality which
continues to remain one of the richest collection of end-user
affordances for working with two-dimensional data.

@node Speech-Enabling Interactive Games
@subsection Speech-Enabling Interactive Games

So in 1997, I went the next step in asking  ---  given access to the
underlying infromation, is it possible to build effective
eyes-free interaction to highly interactive tasks? I picked
@strong{Tetris} as a means of exploring this space, the result was an
Emacspeak extension to speech-enable module @strong{tetris.el}. The
details of what was learned were published as a paper in Assets
98, and expanded as a chapter on Conversational Gestures in my
book on Auditory Interfaces; that book was in a sense a
culmination of stepping back and gaining a sense of perspective
of what I had build during this period. The work on
Conversational Gestures also helped in formalizing the abstract
user interface layer that formed part of the
@url{http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/,XForms} work at the W3C.

Speech-enabling games for effective eyes-free interaction has
proven highly educational. Interactive games are typically built
to challenge the user, and if the eyes-free interface is
inefficient, you just wont play the game  ---  contrast this with a
task that you @strong{must} perform, where you're likely to make do with
a sub-optimal interface. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to
include eyes-free interfaces to several games including @url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris,Tetris},
@url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game),Sudoku}, and of late the popular @url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game),2048 game}. Each of these have in
turn contributed to enhancing the interaction model in Emacspeak,
and those innovations typically make their way to the rest of the
environment.

@node Accessing Media Streams
@section Accessing Media Streams

Streaming real-time audio on the Internet became a reality with
the advent of RealAudio in 1995; soon there were a large number
of media streams available on the Internet ranging from music
streams to live radio stations. But there was an interesting
twist  ---  for the most part, all of these media streams expected
one to look at the screen, even though the primary content was
purely audio (streaming video hadn't arrived yet!). Starting in
1996, Emacspeak started including a variety of eyes-free
front-ends for accessing media streams. Initially, this was
achieved by building a wrapper around @strong{trplayer}  ---  a headless
version of RealPlayer; later I built Emacspeak module
@strong{emacspeak-m-player} for interfacing with package @strong{mplayer}. A
key aspect of streaming media integration in emacspeak is that
one can launch and control streams without ever switching away
from one's primary task; thus, you can continue to type email or
edit code while seamlessly launching and controlling media
streams. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to integrate with
Emacs packages like @strong{emms} as well as providing wrappers for
@strong{mplayer} and @strong{alsaplayer}  ---  collectively, these let you
efficiently launch all types of media streams, including
streaming video, without having to explicitly switch context.


In the mid-90's, Emacspeak started including a directory of media
links to some of the more popular radio stations  ---  primarily as a
means of helping users getting started  ---  Emacs' ability to
rapidly complete directory and file-names turned out to be the
most effective means of quickly launching everything from
streaming radio stations to audio books. And even better  ---  as the
Emacs community develops better and smarter ways of navigating
the filesystem using completions, e.g., package @strong{ido}, these
types of actions become even more efficient!

@node EBooks ---  Ubiquitous Access To Books
@section EBooks ---    Ubiquitous Access To Books

AsTeR  ---  was motivated by the increasing availability of technical
material as online electronic documents. While AsTeR processed
the @TeX{} family of markup languages, more general ebooks came in a
wide range of formats, ranging from plain text generated from
various underlying file formats to structured EBooks, with
Project @url{http://www.gutenberg.org/,Gutenberg} leading the way. During the mid-90's, I had
access to a wide range of electronic materials from sources such
as O'Reilly Publishing and various electronic journals  ---  The Perl
Journal (TPJ) is one that I still remember fondly.

Emacspeak provided fairly light-weight but efficient access to
all of the electronic books I had on my local disk  ---  Emacs'
strengths with respect to browsing textual documents meant that I
needed to build little that was specific to Emacspeak. The late
90's saw the arrival of Daisy as an XML-based format for
accessible electronic books. The last decade has seen the rapid
convergence to @strong{epub} as a distribution format of choice for
electronic books. Emacspeak provides interaction modes that make
organizing, searching and reading these materials on the
Emacspeak Audio Desktop a pleasant experience. Emacspeak also
provides an OCR-Mode  ---  this enables one to call out to an
external OCR program and read the content efficiently.

The somewhat informal process used by publishers like O'Reilly to
make technical material available to users with print impairments
was later formalized by @url{https://www.bookshare.org/,BookShare}  ---  today, qualified users can
obtain a large number of books and periodicals initially as
Daisy-3 and increasingly as @strong{EPub}. BookShare provides a RESTful
API for searching and downloading books; Emacspeak module
@strong{emacspeak-bookshare} implements this API to create a client for
browsing the BookShare library, downloading and organizing books
locally, and an integrated ebook reading mode to round off the
experience.

A useful complement to this suite of tools is the Calibre package
for organizing ones ebook collection; Emacspeak now implements an
@strong{EPub Interaction} mode that leverages Calibre (actually sqlite3)
to search and browse books, along with an integrated @strong{EPub mode}
for reading books.

@node Leveraging Computational Tools  ---  From SQL And R To IPython Notebooks
@section Leveraging Computational Tools  ---   From SQL And R To IPython Notebooks

The ability to invoke external processes and interface with them
via a simple read-eval-loop (REPL) is perhaps one of Emacs'
strongest extension points. This means that a wide variety of
computational tools become immediately available for embedding
within the Emacs environment  ---  a facility that has been widely
exploited by the Emacs community. Over the years, Emacspeak has
leveraged many of these facilities to provide a well-integrated
auditory interface.

Starting from a tight code, eval, test form of iterative
programming as encouraged by Lisp. Applied to languages like
Python and Ruby to exploratory computational tools such as R for
data analysis and SQL for database interaction, the Emacspeak
Audio Desktop has come to encompass a collection of rich
computational tools that provide an efficient eyes-free
experience.


In this context, module @strong{ein}  ---  Emacs IPython Notebooks  --- 
provides another excellent example of an Emacs tool that helps
interface seamlessly with others in the technical domain. IPython
Notebooks provide an easy means of reaching a large audience when
publishing technical material with interactive computational
content; module @strong{ein} brings the power and convenience of Emacs '
editting facilities when developing the content. Speech-enabling
package @strong{ein} is a major win since editting program source code
in an eyes-free environment is far smoother in Emacs than in a
browser-based editor.

@node Social Web  ---  EMail Instant Messaging Blogging And Tweeting Using Open Protocols
@section Social Web   ---  EMail, Instant Messaging, Blogging  And Tweeting Using Open Protocols

The ability to process large amounts of email and electronic news
has always been a feature of Emacs. I started using package @strong{vm}
for email in 1990, along with @strong{gnus} for Usenet access many years
before developing Emacspeak. So these were the first major
packages that Emacspeak speech-enabled. Being able to access the
underlying data structures used to visually render email messages
and Usenet articles enabled Emacspeak to produce rich, succinct
auditory output  ---  this vastly increased my ability to consume and
organize large amounts of information. Toward the turn of the
century, instant messaging arrived in the mainstream  ---  package
@strong{tnt} provided an Emacs implementation of a chat client that
could communicate with users on the then popular AOL Instant
Messenger platform. At the time, I worked at IBM Research, and
inspired by package @strong{tnt}, I created an Emacs client called
@strong{ChatterBox} using the Lotus Sametime API  ---  this enabled me to
communicate with colleagues at work from the comfort of
Emacs. Packages like @strong{vm}, @strong{gnus}, @strong{tnt} and @strong{ChatterBox} provide
an interesting example of how availability of a clean underlying
API to a specific service or content stream can encourage the
creation of efficient (and different) user interfaces. The
touchstone of such successful implementations is a simple test  --- 
can the user of a specific interface tell if the person whom he
is communicating with is also using the same interface? In each
of the examples enumerated above, a user at one end of the
communication chain cannot tell, and in fact shouldn't be able to
tell what client the user at the other end is using. Contrast
this with closed services that have an inherent @emph{lock-in} model
e.g., proprietary word processors that use undocumented
serialization formats  ---  for a fun read, see this write-up on
@url{http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/publications/colored-paper.html,Universe Of Fancy Colored Paper}.


Today, my personal choice for instant messaging is the open
Jabber platform. I connect to Jabber via Emacs package
@strong{emacs-jabber} and with Emacspeak providing a light-weight
wrapper for generating the eyes-free interface, I can communicate
seamlessly with colleagues and friends around the world.

As the Web evolved to encompass ever-increasing swathes of
communication functionality that had already been available on
the Internet, we saw the world move from Usenet groups to @strong{Blogs}
 ---  I remember initially dismissing the blogging phenomenon as just
a re-invention of Usenet in the early days. However, mainstream
users flocked to Blogging, and I later realized that blogging as
a publishing platform brought along interesting features that
made communicating and publishing information @strong{much} easier. In
2005, I joined Google; during the winter holidays that year, I
implemented a light-weight client for Blogger that became the
start of Emacs package @strong{g-client}  ---  this package provides Emacs
wrappers for Google services that provide a RESTful API.

@node The RESTful Web  ---  Web Wizards And URL Templates For Faster Access
@section The RESTful Web  ---   Web Wizards And URL Templates For Faster Access

Today, the Web, based on URLs and HTTP-style protocols is widely
recognized as a platform in its own right. This platform emerged
over time  ---  to me, Web APIs arrived in the late 90's when I
observed the following with respect to my own behavior on many
popular sites:

@enumerate
@item
I opened a Web page that took a while to load (remember,  I
was still using Emacs-W3),
@item
I then searched through the page to find a form-field that
I filled out, e.g., start and end destinations on Yahoo
Maps,
@item
I hit @strong{submit}, and once again waited for a heavy-weight
HTML page to load,
@item
And finally, I hunted through the rendered content to find
what I was looking for.
@end enumerate

This pattern repeated across a wide-range of interactive Web
sites ranging from AltaVista for search (this was pre-Google),
Yahoo Maps for directions, and Amazon for product searches to
name but a few. So I decided to automate away the pain by
creating Emacspeak module @strong{emacspeak-websearch} that did the
following:

@enumerate
@item
Prompt via the minibuffer for the requisite fields,
@item
Consed up an HTTP GET URL,
@item
Retrieved this URL,
@item
And filtered out the specific portion of the HTML  DOM that
held the generated response.
@end enumerate

Notice that the above implementation hard-wires the CGI parameter
names used by a given Web application into the code implemented
in module @strong{emacspeak-websearch}. REST as a design pattern had not
yet been recognized, leave alone formalized, and module
@strong{emacspeak-websearch} was initially criticized as being fragile.

However, over time, the CGI parameter names remained fixed  ---  the
 only things that have required updating in the Emacspeak
 code-base are the content filtering rules that extract the
 response  ---  for popular services, this has averaged about one to
 two times a year.


I later codified these filtering rules in terms of XPath, and
also integrated XSLT-based pre-processing of incoming HTML
content before it got handed off to Emacs-W3  ---  and yes,
Emacs/Advice once again came in handy with respect to injecting
XSLT pre-processing into Emacs-W3!

Later, in early 2000, I created companion module
@strong{emacspeak-url-templates}  ---  partially inspired by Emacs'
@strong{webjump} module. URL templates in Emacspeak leveraged the
recognized REST interaction pattern to provide a large collection
of Web widgets that could be quickly invoked to provide rapid
access to the right pieces of information on the Web.

The final icing on the cake was the arrival of RSS and Atom feeds
and the consequent deep-linking into content-rich sites  ---  this
meant that Emacspeak could provide audio renderings of useful
content without having to deal with complex visual navigation!
While Google Reader existed, Emacspeak provided a light-weight
@strong{greader} client for managing ones feed subscriptions; with the
demise of Google Reader, I implemented module @strong{emacspeak-feeds}
for organizing feeds on the Emacspeak desktop. A companion
package @strong{emacspeak-webspace} implements additional goodies
including a continuously updating ticker of headlines taken from
the user's collection of subscribed feeds.

@section Mashing It Up  ---   Leveraging Evolving Web APIs

The next step in this evolution came with the arrival of richer
Web APIs  ---  especially ones that defined a clean client/server
separation. In this respect, the world of Web APIs is a somewhat
mixed bag in that many Web sites equate a Web API with a JS-based
API that can be exclusively invoked from within a Web-Browser
run-time. The issue with that type of API binding is that the
only runtime that is supported is a full-blown Web browser; but
the arrival of native mobile apps has actually proven a net
positive in encouraging sites to create a cleaner
separation. Emacspeak has leveraged these APIs to create
Emacspeak front-ends to many useful services, here are a few:

@enumerate
@item
Minibuffer completion for Google Search using Google Suggest
to provide completions.
@item
Librivox for browsing  and playing free audio books.
@item
NPR  for browsing and playing NPR archived programs.
@item
BBC for playing a wide variety of streaming content
available from the BBC.
@item
A Google Maps front-end that  provides instantaneous access
to directions and Places search.
@item
Access to Twitter via package @strong{twittering-mode}.
@end enumerate


And a lot more than will fit this margin! This is an example of
generalizing the concept of a mashup as seen on the Web with
respect to creating hybrid applications by bringing together a
collection of different Web APIs. Another way to think of such
separation is to view an application as a @strong{head} and a @strong{body}  --- 
where the @strong{head} is a specific user interface, with the @strong{body}
implementing the application logic. A cleanly defined separation
between the @strong{head} and @strong{body} allows one to attach @emph{different}
user interfaces i.e., @strong{heads} to the given @strong{body} without any
loss of functionality, or the need to re-implement the entire
application. Modern platforms like Android enable such separation
via an
@url{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html,Intent}
mechanism. The Web platform as originally defined around URLs is
actually well-suited to this type of separation  ---  though the full
potential of this design pattern remains to be fully realized
given today's tight association of the Web to the Web Browser.

@section Conclusion --- Turning Twenty

In 1996, I wrote an article entitled
@url{http://www.drdobbs.com/user-interface-a-means-to-an-end/184410453,User
Interface  ---  A Means To An End} pointing out that the size and
shape of computers were determined by the keyboard and
display. This is even more true in today's world of tablets,
phablets and large-sized phones  ---  with the only difference that
the keyboard has been replaced by a touch screen. The next
generation in the evolution of @strong{personal} devices is that they
will become truly personal by being wearables  ---  this once again
forces a separation of the user interface peripherals from the
underlying compute engine. Imagine a variety of wearables that
collectively connect to ones cell phone, which itself connects to
the cloud for all its computational and information needs. Such
an environment is rich in possibilities for creating a wide
variety of user experiences to a single underlying body of
information; Eyes-Free interfaces as pioneered by systems like
Emacspeak will come to play an increasingly vital role alongside
visual interaction when this comes to pass.
