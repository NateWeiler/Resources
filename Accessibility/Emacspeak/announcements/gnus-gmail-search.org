* Executive Summary 

I have been using the following to search GMail from GNUS for over 8
years now. The recent announcement of the _nnselect_ back-end reminded
me that I had never gotten to writing this up formally, So here
goes. With the described solution in place, you can search your GMail
from within  GNUS using the same GMail Search operators  that you're
familiar with from within  your Web Browser, e.g. searches of the form
/from: foo/,  /subject:bar/, /after:date/ and combinations of the
above.

* Background 

You can read email with GNUS, and many people read GMail with GNUS,
however, the details of GMail setup with GNUS wont fit this margin.  For my own
GMail setup using Ceasar's excellent _auth-xoauth2_ package, see file
[[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/tvr/gnus-gmail-prepare.el][gnus-gmail-prepare.el]].

* Leveraging GNUS Back-end NNIR To Search GMail

GMail is accessed from GNUS using the imap protocol.  The _imap_
specification defines a set of standard search operators; GMail itself
defines a slightly different and arguably easier to use set of search
operators. Module
[[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/g-client/gm-nnir.el][gm-nnir]]
implements both the standard IMap search operator as well as GMail's
search operators; in practice, I have mostly only used the GMail
Search operators in the last 8 years since implementing this module.

Without further ado, here is the  code to enable GMail Search:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun gm-nnir-group-make-gmail-group (query)
  "Use GMail search syntax.
See https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en for syntax. "
  (interactive "sGMail Query: ")  
  (let ((nnir-imap-default-search-key "imap")
        (q (format "X-GM-RAW \"%s\"" query)))
    (cond
     ((gnus-group-group-name)           ; Search current group
      (gnus-group-make-nnir-group
       nil                              ; no extra params needed
       `(nnir-specs (nnir-query-spec (query ,q)))))
     (t (error "Not on a group.")))))
#+END_SRC

I bind the above to _/_ by using
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key gnus-group-mode-map "/" 'gm-nnir-group-make-gmail-group)
#+END_SRC




* Example Of Use

I am subscribed to list _emacs-devel@gnu.org_ and email sent to that
list gets GMail Label ~emacs-devel~. In Gnus, I open that label as
group ~emacs-devel@gnu.org~. Typing _/_ on the group line and entering
: from:rms after:2020/09/01
in the minibuffer results in the following:

: 1.1 Re: Good first issues to contribute Richard Stallman 05-Sep [5.3k]
: 2.1 Lars Ingebrigtsen is now one of the Emacs maintainers Richard Stallman 06-Sep [4.9k]
: 3.1 Re: A new user perspective about "Changes for emacs 28" Richard Stallman 07-Sep [5.5k]
: 4.5 Re: Changes for emacs 28 Richard Stallman 07-Sep [5.3k]
: 5.1  Richard Stallman 07-Sep <6.2k>
: 6.1  Richard Stallman 07-Sep <6.0k>
: 7.1  Richard Stallman 07-Sep <5.5k>
: 8.1  Richard Stallman 07-Sep <5.7k>
: 



The search above creates an ephemeral group with matching messages
appearing as shown above, you can read messages, reply to them and do
anything else that you might ordinarily do within the GNUS interface.
