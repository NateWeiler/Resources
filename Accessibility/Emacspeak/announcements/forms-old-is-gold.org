* Executive Summary 

Given a file containing data records made up of multiple fields, you
can easily view them using Emacs' ~forms~ library.

* Background: BBC Program Listings 

I use Perl utility ~get_player~ to fetch details of BBC Radio
programs. When I was using this frequently, I had installed package
~iplayer.el~ from Melpa --- that package presented the data as   a 
nicely organized  Org document. Time passed,  and I somehow stopped
using it, until ... last week. Then I discovered that package
~iplayer~ on Melpa hadn't been updated in a few years, and worse had
broken because package ~org~ no longer includes now obsoleted
sub-module ~orgstruct~.


* Task: Viewing BBC Program Listings 

When I realized package ~iplayer~ was broken, I tried to make up for
its loss for a few days by using shell-level utilities like ~cut~. But
then I missed the convenience of being able to work with the data with
all of Emacs' power and was initially tempted to write a new package
--- after all, how hard is it to take a record, split it into fields
and display it in a desired form? Fortunately, I remembered another of
my favorite edicts from the creator of Perl (Larry Wall) 
: Lazy Programmer Is A Good Programmer

At the same time I had a strong sense of dejavu --- in the early daysa
of Emacspeak (approx 1995), I remembered demonstrating the power of
Emacs to manipulate and display data records by using  file
_/etc/passwd_ as an example.

* The Free Solution 

So the completely free (AKA zero-work) solution I used was to leverage
Emacs' built-in ~forms~ library --- the solution
as created  
in
[[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/etc/forms/get-iplayer.el#L3][get-iplayer.el]] is below:



#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq forms-read-only t)
(setq forms-file (expand-file-name "~/.get_iplayer/radio.cache"))
(setq forms-number-of-fields 16)
(setq forms-field-sep "|")
(setq forms-format-list
      (list
       "Id: "  1 "\t" "Name: " 3 "\n"
       "Episode: " 4 "\t" "Description: "  12 "\n"))
#+END_SRC


With the above in place, you can:

  1. M-x forms-find-file RET get-iplayer.el
  2. This  displays one record at  a time as specified by ~forms-format-list~.
  3. You can  search through records etc.
