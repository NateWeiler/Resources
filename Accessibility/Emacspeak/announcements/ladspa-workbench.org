* Executive Summary 

Module =ladspa.el=  in the Emacspeak GitHub repository implements a
high-level interface for experimenting with Ladspa Plugins using
=MPlayer= and =SoX=.

* Module =ladspa.el=

This  module implements the following functionality:

  1. Builds up a table of installed Ladspa plugins along with their
     associated metadata.
  2. Command =M-x ladspa= displays  installed Ladspa Plugins in a
     special =*Ladspa*= buffer.
  3. Plugins can be instantiated by pressing =RET=.
  4. Instantiating a plugin prompts for its arguments and displays the
     instantiated plugin in a new buffer.
  5. This plugin can then be applied to a running =MPlayer= media
     stream by pressing =a=.
  6. The effect can be deleted by pressing =d=.
  7. Plugin parameters can be edited  by pressing =e= with point on
     the parameter to edit.

* Interfacing With SoX

Module =sox.el= implements an *Audio Workbench* using =SoX=. Module
=ladspa.el= integrates with that module by allowing the addition of
=ladspa= as a supported SoX effect. Adding a =ladspa= effect results
in a completion interface for picking one of the available Ladspa
plugin; once selected, that plugin then prompts for its parameters as
needed.
