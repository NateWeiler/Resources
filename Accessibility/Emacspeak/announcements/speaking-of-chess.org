* Overview 

** Research question: 

   What type of spoken feedback does one need to:

    1. Learn Chess.
    2. Examine and learn from games.
    3. Play effectively.
    4. View the state of the game from different perspectives during a game.
    5. Provide auditory feedback that is both succinct and maximally informative.
    6. Arrive at  a spoken notation for speaking various game states
       that is both expressive and time-efficient.


** Speech-Enabling Chess In Emacspeak


To answer some or all of the above questions, I speech-enabled Emacs
Chess last weekend via module [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/emacspeak-chess.el#L41][emacspeak-chess.el]]  — see [[http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002dchess.html#emacspeak_002dchess][User Manual]]
for complete end-user documentation.

Module ~emacspeak-chess~ speech-enables Emacs Chess by:

  1. Providing interactive commands that let the user navigate and browse the
     chessboard along the eight compass directions from the current square.
  2. Spoken output uses audio-formatting  — subtle changes in voice
     characteristics backed up by auditory icons  — to indicate the
     color of squares and pieces.
  3. Speaking each  current  move as it happens.
  4. Adding the same spoken output to ~emacs chess~ commands for
     moving back and forth through a game.
  

In the above, all of the heavy lifting is done by three  functions:

  - [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/emacspeak-chess.el#L146-L178][emacspeak-chess-describe-square]]: Speak state of current square.
- [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/emacspeak-chess.el#L1-L269][emacspeak-chess-collect-squares]]: Collect squares along a given rank,
  file, or diagonal, starting at and including the current square.
  -  [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/emacspeak-chess.el#L146-L383][emacspeak-chess-describe-move]]: Describe current move.


Share And Enjoy!
