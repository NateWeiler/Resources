* Auditory Icon Theme: 3d 

[[http://www.csounds.com/][CSound]] is a sophisticated music sound synthesis system with a
strong community of developers.  I've played off and on with
CSound ever since the early 90's  and have always been intrigued
by the possibility of   algorithmically creating new auditory icon themes for
Emacspeak  using CSound.

Over the holidays last December, I finally got around to creating
my first complete CSound-generated auditory icon theme -- it is
now checked into Emacspeak SVN as theme [[http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sounds/3d/][3d]]. This theme is best
experienced with headphones --- many of the generated icons use
spatial audio to good effect.
