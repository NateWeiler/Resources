* Executive Summary 

Emacspeak module [[http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/soundscape.html][soundscape]] adds the ability to automatically switch
*Soundscapes* based on the current buffer. A *Soundscape* can be any
continuously playing stream of audio; in practice, using nature sounds
that repeat softly in a pseudo-random manner appears to be
effective. Soundscapes are activated based on the currently active
/Emacs Major Mode/ and as a consequence directly mirror the user's
current activity. The present implementation uses Python package
[[http://boodler.org][Boodler]] to generate soundscapes.

* Usage 

Note that package ~soundscape.el~ does not have any Emacspeak
dependencies. See the [[http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/soundscape][package documentation]] for details on installing
and configuring [[http://boodler.org][Boodler]]. 

You can experiment with installed Boodler agents using command
~soundscape~ and ~soundscape-stop~. You can enable and disable
/automatic soundscapes/ using command ~soundscape-toggle~. The
currently active default Soundscape theme can be inspected via command
~soundscape-theme~ --- this produces a buffer that lists the
currently defined /major-mode -> Soundscape mapping. 

Package ~soundscape.el~ considers the inheritance relationship among
Emacs major-modes when computing the set of /soundscapes/ to
activate.As an example, _eww-mode_ inherits from _special-mode_ --- as
a consequence, two soundscapes (/LightWind/ and /BackgroundWaves/)
become active when reading Web content.

* Default Major-Mode->Soundscape (Mood) Mapping:

Here is a table showing the mapping of major-mmodes to Soundscape
moods at the time of writing. For readability, I have stripped out the
_package-name_ for these soundscapes.

* Soundscape Research

I implemented package ~soundscape.el~ to create a platform that would
let me experiment with different tools that aid in
concentration. After using Soundscapes for about a week, I have also
found that it reduces some of the fatigue that results from having to
listen to synthetic text-to-speech for extended  periods.
The true value (if any) of this package will be a function of how heavily
I find myself using it six months from now --- as a metric, /complete
success/  might mean that in mid-2016, I still  have automatic
soundscapes turned on.
As I type this article in Emacs _org-mode_, I hear  the sound of
water-drops falling softly in the background, and I take note
that I have not switched tasks  for the entire time I have spent
writing this article.

Other success metrics --- harder to measure --- might include how
effective Soundscapes are in helping the user stay focused on a
given activity for extended periods of time. In an ever-connected
world buzzing with a constant stream of distractions ranging from
incoming email and instant-messages to a flood of twitter updates,
this is likely the most relevant metric.
