* Emacspeak Was Released Twenty Years Ago Today

The more things change, the more they remain the same.

Emacspeak was released 20 years ago on April 25, 1995 with [[http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/releases/release-3.0.html][this
announcement]]. The Emacspeak mailing list itself did not exist in its
present form --- note that the original announcement talks about a
mailing list at DEC CRL.  When Greg started the mailing list at
Vassar, we seeded the list from some/all of the messages from the
archive for the mailing list at DEC.e
