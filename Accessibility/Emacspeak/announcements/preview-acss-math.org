* Overview

This article previews a new feature in the next Emacspeak release  — 
audio-formatted Mathematics using Aural CSS. [[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vxs][ Volker Sorge]] worked
at Google as a Visiting Scientist from Sep 2012 to August 2013, when
we implemented [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyWu9HB9QtU][math
access in ChromeVox]]  —  see [[http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/][this brief overview]]. Since leaving
Google, Volker has refactored and extended his work to create an Open
Source [[https://github.com/zorkow/speech-rule-engine][Speech-Rule-Engine]] implemented using NodeJS. This
speech-rule-engine can be used in many different environments;
Emacspeak leverages that work to enable audio-formatting and
interactive browsing of math content.


* Overview Of Functionality 

Math access on the Emacspeak desktop is implemented via module
[[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/emacspeak-maths.el#L558][emacspeak-maths.el]]  —  see [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/js/node/Readme.org#L40][js/node/Readme.org]] in the Emacspeak GitHub
repository for setup instructions. 

Once loaded, module ~emacspeak-maths~ provides a /Math Navigator/ that
implements the user interface for sending Math expressions to the
Speech-Rule-Engine, and for interactively browsing the resulting
structure. At each step of the interaction, Emacspeak receives math
expressions that have been annotated with Aural CSS and produces
audio-formatted output. The audio-formatted text can itself be
navigated in a special /*Spoken Math*/ emacs buffer.

Module ~emacspeak-maths.el~ implements various affordances for
dispatching mathematical content to the Speech-Rule-Engine  —  see
usage examples in the next section.

* Usage Examples 

** The Emacspeak Maths Navigator

  - The /maths navigator/ can be invoked by pressing _S-SPC_ (hold
    down Windows key and press SPC)   —  this runs the command _emacspeak-maths-navigator/body_.
  - Once invoked, the /Maths Navigator can be used to enter an
    expression to read.
  - Pressing _SPC_ again prompts for the LaTeX math expression.
  - Pressing  _RET_ guesses the expression to read from the current context.
  - The arrow keys navigate the expression being read.
  - Pressing _o_ switches to the /*Spoken Math*/ buffer and exits the
    navigator.

See the [[http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002dmaths.html#emacspeak_002dmaths][relevant chapter]] in the online Emacspeak manual for details.

** Math Content In LaTeX Documents 




  1. Open a LaTeX document containing math content.
  2. Move point to a line containing   mathematical markup.
  3. Press _S-SPC_ _RET_ to have that expression audio-formatted.
  4. Use arrow keys to navigate the resulting structure.
  5. Press any other key to exit the navigator.

** Math Content On Wikipedia 

  1. Open a Wikipedia page in the Emacs Web Wowser (EWW) that has
     mathematical content.
  2. Wikipedia displays math as images, with the alt-text giving the
     LaTeX representation.
  3. Navigate to some math content on the page, then press _S-SPC_
     _a_ to speak that content  —  _a_ is for alt.
  4. As an example, navigate to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement][Wikipedia Math Example]], locate math expressions on that page, then
     press _S-SPC a_.

** Math Content From The Emacs Calculator 


  1. The built-in Emacs Calculator (~calc~) provides  many complex
     math functions including symbolic algebra.
  2. For my personal ~calc~ setup, see  [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/tvr/calc-prepare.el#L25][tvr/calc-prepare.el]] in the
     Emacspeak GitHub repo.
  3. This setting below sets up the Emacs Calculator to output results
     as LaTeX: _(setq calc-language 'tex)_
  4. With the above setting in effect, launch the emacs Calculator by
     pressing _M-##_.
  5. Press _'_ — to use algebraic mode —  and enter ~sin(x)~.
  6. Press _a t_ to get the Taylor series expansion of the above
     expression, and press _x_ when prompted for the variable.
  7. This displays the Taylor Series expansion up to the desired
     number of terms  —  try _7_ terms.
  8. Now, with Calc having shown the results as TeX, press _S-SPC_
     _RET_ to browse this expression using the /Maths Navigator/.
  


* And The Best Is Yet To Come

This is intentionally called an /early preview/ because there is still
much that can be improved:

  1. Enhance the rule engine to infer and convey more semantics.
  2. Improved audio formatting rules to better present the available information.
  3. Update/tune the use of Aural CSS properties to best leverage
     today's TTS engines.
  4. Integrate math-reading functionality into more usage contexts in
     addition to the ones enumerated in this article.
