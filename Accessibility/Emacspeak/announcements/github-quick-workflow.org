The [[https://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2020/05/github-standard-fork-and-pull-request.html][previous article]] covered   the fork/create-pullreq workflow for
GitHub without using a browser.
It turns out that in learning by doing, I had made a few mis-steps
that made things a lot more convoluted. Here is a quick cheat-sheet on
how to do this exclusively   with Magit/Forge.

  1. Run _M-x magit-status_  on your Git clone of the project   to
     which you wish to contribute.
  2. Add your GitHub user-id _"tvraman"_ in my case to forge custom
     option  _forge-owned-accounts_.
  3. In the _magit-status_ buffer above, type _'cf_ to create the fork
     and answer the prompts with the defaults as they appear in the minibuffer.
  4. Create your feature branch, add your contribution and check-in.
  5. In the _magit-status_ buffer, type _'cp_ to create the
     pull-request.

Share And Enjoy!
