* Summary: 

Emacspeak development is moving from [[http://emacspeak.googlecode.com][Google Code Hosting]] to [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak][GitHub]].
If you have been running from the SVN repository, I recommend you
switch to the GitHub version by executing:

: git clone https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak.git
: make config
: make -j
  - If using Outloud TTS:
:  cd servers/linux-outloud  &&  make
  - If using Espeak TTS:
:  cd servers/linux-espeak && make
  - After this,  all you should need to stay up to date is a periodic 
: git pull; make config; make 

* A Brief History 

  - The first five years of Emacspeak development used a local RCS
    repository on my home machine (1994 --1999).
  - The first few releases of Emacspeak were distributed through the
    Web site and FTP server at Digital Research; they were also
    mirrored at Cornell.
  - After moving to Adobe Systems in the fall of 1995, Emacspeak was
    distributed exclusively through my Web page on the Cornell CS
    Department Web server, which also hosted my personal Web site.
  - In 2000, I created [[http://emacspeak.sf.net][Emacspeak On SourceForge]]
  and used that site for both hosting the Emacspeak source code as
  well as the Web site --- coincidentally, I lost the ability to
  update my Web site at [[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman][Cornell CS]] around the same time.
  - Over time it became harder and harder to publish new Emacspeak
    releases through the SourceForge interface. Luckily, Google Code
    Hosting came along a few months after I joined Google, and moving
    the source code repository to [[http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk][Google Code SVN]] was a no-brainer.
  - My friend and colleague Fitz helped me migrate the 5+ years of CVS
    history to SVN; this meant that the source code repository on
    Google Code also recorded all of the development history that had
    been built up on Sourceforge.
  - Now, it's time to move to GitHub. I've been using Git for most of
    my work the last few years, but was simply too lazy to move
    Emacspeak development from SVN to Git on GoogleCode.
  - But over time, the advantages present in Git as a source control
    system and GitHub as a hosting service have increased --- primary
    among these --- a rich set of Emacs tools that have been written
    to leverage the GitHub API.
  - For Git integration in Emacs, my personal preference is package
    Magit available through Elpa ---
: M-x package-install magit in Emacs.
  - The GitHub Web site itself is fairly heavy-weight in terms of its
    use of scripting, i.e. performing all operations through the
    [[http://github.com][github.com]] Web site from within Emacs is fairly unpleasant.  But
    the afore-mentioned GitHub API makes this a non-issue at this
    point with respect to the type of workflow I prefer.
  - So this week, I did the work to migrate Emacspeak development to
    [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak][Emacspeak On GitHub]].

* Status Of Migration 

  - With help from some of the kind folk at Google Code Hosting, I've
    successfully migrated the source code repository including all
    release tags to GitHub.
  - I am now checking in changes into GitHub; the SVN repository on
    Google Code Hosting is now frozen, and I do not plan to make any
    commits there.
  - I presently have no immediate plans to start using features of
    GitHub like the Issue Tracker; for now we will continue to use the
    Emacspeak mailing list which has served us well for 20 years.
  - I have also taken this opportunity to prune out legacy portions of
    the Emacspeak codebase by moving modules to _obsolete_ at each
    level of the directory tree.
  - Since starting the [[http://emacspeak.blogspot.com][Emacspeak Blog]] in late 2005, I have published a
    sequence of articles describing Emacspeak features and usage
    patterns; I felt that having these articles for local reference
    made a useful supplement to the emacspeak online
    documentation. Toward this end, I have downloaded all articles
    published so far and checked in both XML and HTML versions into
    sub-directory _blogs_.
  - Note that newer articles are also available as .org files under sub-directory _announcements_.

* Next Steps 

  - I still need to learn how to do software releases on GitHub.
