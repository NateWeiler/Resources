* Exploring  BBC  Podcasts And Program Archives

** Summary

A short overview of tools on the emacspeak desktop for easily
exploring and accessing BBC program content.

** Background 

The BBC offers a wealth of audio content from both domestic BBC
Radio as well as BBC World Service.
Much of this content is available as Podcasts for a week after it
has been broadcast; in some instances, content is archived and
available for more than a week.


The  primary gateway to this content is BBC IPlayer. In
addition, one can subscribe to RSS feeds for BBC Podcasts.
** Accessing BBC Content From Emacspeak

Here are some of the tools I  use on the Emacspeak desktop to
quickly find and access content from the BBC:

  - The BBC publishes a continuously updated directory of 
     RSS feeds; Emacspeak url template  *BBC Podcast Directory*
    can be used to open this directory of feeds.
  - With the above directory of feeds at hand, it is easy to
    subscribe to oft-accessed feeds via *emacspeak-feeds* â€” see
    [[http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/12/managing-and-accessing-feeds-on.html][Managing And Accessing Feeds]].
  - In addition to the directory of feeds covered above, the BBC
    publishes a detailed program guide as XML; Emacspeak url
    template *BBC  Program Guide* accesses the program guide.
  - The program guide described above gives access to RSS feeds
    for both current programs as 
  well as past archives. The program guide is a wealth of
information that makes all the information available in one
location, unlike the BBC IPlayer site.
  - A note for UK users; the program guide above is presently set
    up to  only show content that is available world-wide; if
    you're in the UK, you may want to remove the test for
: region='all'
  in the XSL  stylesheet  emacspeak/xsl/bbc-ppg.xsl.
  - You can find the [[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/ppg.xml][XML feed]] for the BBC Program Guide, as well
    as the associated [[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/ppg.xsd][XML Schema]] definition on the BBC's Web
    site.
  - Finally, you can access the BBC IPlayer page for any given
    BBC channel via Emacspeak url template *BBC IPlayer*.

*Share And Enjoy!* And Hear's Wishing Everyone A Very Happy 2014!
