different views of HTML  content.

They can be applied to WWW content before being displayed on

Acknowledgments:

I'd like to thank Ken Holland of Crane Software for
providing me an accessible version of the materials he used
during a full-day XSLT tutorial offered at WWW 2000.

I'd also like to thank OReilly Systems for providing me an

Finally, I'd like to thank the W3C XSLT working group for
