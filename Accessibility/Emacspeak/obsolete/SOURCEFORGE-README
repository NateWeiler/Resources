Note that the working version of emacspeak is found under
cvs directory emacspeak At the time I first imported
Emacspeak into sourceforge CVS I thought of importing it as
a set of separate modules --but soon gave up the idea.  Thus
the etc info and other subdirs found at top-level are
obselete and should be nuked --they remain only because the
CVS server seems to be confused and denies me write access
to those directories.


Note that this applies only to the SourceForge CVS version -- not
to the  SVN version.
