<sect1 id="introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>	
	Emacspeak is a Linux application that allows
	users to get synthesized speech output inside the Emacs
	desktop environment. Because Emacspeak is actually integrated
	into the Emacs environment (instead of
	just running "on top" of an environment like most screen
	readers), Emacspeak provides much
	more context-specific information than its commercial screen
	reader counterparts.  In this sense, Emacspeak is not a
	"screen reader," but rather a subsystem of Emacs that produces
	speech output.
	</para>
   
	<para>
	Although Emacspeak only works inside Emacs, there are a
	large number of both built-in and add-on applications for Emacs that
	do everything from keeping track of your appointments to
	playing CDs to coding HTML.  In addition, Emacs has a special
	command shell mode that can be used to run any command-line
	application. 
	</para>

	<para>
	This HOWTO focuses on installing Emacspeak on your
	Linux system. It does not discuss how to actually use Emacs or
	Emacspeak - for information on usage, refer to the
	Emacspeak User's Guide, available at <ulink url="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net"></ulink>.

<sect1 ID="requirements">
<title>Requirements</title>

	<para>
	There are a number of things you must have before you install
	Emacspeak, including Linux, a Linux-compatible sound card,
	Emacs, and a
	hardware or software speech synthesizer. You should read this section
	carefully before installing Emacspeak, because Emacspeak will not function correctly
	if any of the requirements are missing.
	</para>

<sect2 ID="linux-distros">
<title>Linux Distributions</title>

	<para>
	This HOWTO assumes that you have already installed Linux on
	your system.  If not, you may wish to refer to the "Linux
	Information Sheet" by Michael K. Johnson at <ulink
	url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html"></ulink>.
	It provides an introduction to Linux,
	discusses some hardware requirements, and also has a section on
	how to obtain Linux.
	</para>

	<para>
	There are a number of different Linux
	distributions (distros) that you can choose from. All of the
	distros are based upon
	the same basic Linux code, or kernel, but each distro has a different
	installation process,
	features, and support options. Martin Wheeler's "Distributions
	HOWTO," at <ulink
	url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Distributions-HOWTO/index.html"></ulink>,
	discusses the pros and cons of a number of Linux distros.
	You can also find information about each distribution on
	their respective web sites. Those distros known to support
	Emacspeak are listed below with their URLs:
	</para>

	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	All of the distributions listed above can be downloaded free of charge
	from their respective web sites. However, the downloads are quite large,
	so you'll need a fast Internet connection. You will also need
	access to a CD burner, to burn your own CDs
	from the images you download. Depending on the distribution,
	you may also have to download and make a boot floppy. Once you
	have burned the CDs and created the boot floppy, you can
	install Linux.  Alternatively, you can purchase the
	disks at your local computer store for between $30 and $80
	US. Both of these options are discussed at length in the Linux
	Installation HOWTO at <ulink
	url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/overview.html"></ulink>,
	so you may want to refer there before making a decision as to
	which route to take.
	</para>

	<para>
	Most methods of installation require sighted assistance.
	However, if you prefer to install Linux yourself, there are
	two options.  The first is to install Linux from a DOS machine
	running JAWS. This option requires two machines, a null modem
	cable, JAWS for DOS, and a hardware speech
	synthesizer. More information on this option can be found
	in <xref linkend="appendixa">, Appendix A.  The
	second option is installing one of the distributions that
	includes a Speakup kernel patch.  This option requires a Speakup-enabled
	distro and a hardware synthesizer. Speakup is a screen reader
	that is patched into the kernel, so it starts talking
	at boot and will speak during the entire installation. Currently,
	Speakup is supported on Debian, Red Hat 7.1, and Slackware.
	The Speakup option also requires you to download the CD images and make your own CDs.
	Refer to the Speakup home page at <ulink url="http://www.linux-speakup.org"></ulink> for
	instructions for this option.
	</para>
 
	<para>
	For assistance with installing Linux, Eric Raymond's Linux
	Installation HOWTO, at <ulink
	url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO"></ulink>,
	is highly recommended reading.
	In the HOWTO, Eric discusses hardware requirements, choosing a
	distro, and installing your distro of choice. If Eric's HOWTO
	does not provide enough installation-specific information,
	you can refer to the documentation specific to your
	distribution, available at the URLs given in the distro list. 
	</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 ID="emacs">
<title>Emacs</title>

	<para>
	Because Emacspeak is an Emacs subsystem, you must have Emacs
	installed for Emacspeak to work.  Most distributions include Emacs by
	default, so it should be installed on your system when you
	install Linux. 
	</para>

	<para>
	If you do not have Emacs on your system or you want to check on the latest version of Emacs, refer to
	the Emacs homepage at <ulink
	url="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"></ulink>.
	If you install Emacs on your own or choose to upgrade, be sure
	to install all of Emacs, including both the X and non-X
	versions (even if you do not plan to use X). Some Emacs
	applications depend on packages included in the X version,
	even if you use those applications in the non-X version of Emacs.
	</para>

	<para>
	If you would like to learn more about Emacs and how to use it,
	an excellent place to start is the Emacs Beginner's HOWTO, by
	Jeremy D. Zawondy.  It's available at <ulink
	url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html"></ulink>.
	There is also an online manual available at <ulink
	url="http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs/index.html"></ulink>.
	Alternatively, you can try the built-in Emacs tutorial. To
	start the tutorial, type <command>C-h t</command>.
	</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="applications">
<title>Background applications</title>

	<para>
	Emacspeak depends on a number of applications. Because each Linux
	distribution comes with different applications, you may find that
	your distro does not quite have everything that
	Emacspeak needs to run properly.  Therefore, before you
	install anything else, it is important to make
	sure you have all the necessary applications, as listed below.
	</para>

	<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
		<listitem>
			<para>
			<command>Tk, Tcl,</command> and <command>Tclx</command>: Check
			to make sure you have these applications.  If
			not, download and install the following
			rpms from <ulink

			</para>

			<para>
			Lesstif can be downloaded from
			either the Lesstif home page <ulink
			url="http://www.lesstif.org"></ulink> or Sourceforge
			<ulink
			url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lesstif"></ulink>.
			Currently, the latest release of Lesstif is
			version 0.93.14; however, Marty Moore
			recommends using the 0.92.32 version.  You can
			either download the gzipped tarball that
			contains all the necessary files or download the
			three individual packages (<filename>lesstif-mwm-0.92.32-1.i386.rpm</filename>,
			<filename>lesstif-clients-0.92.32-1.i386.rpm</filename>,
			and
			<filename>lesstif-devel-0.92.32-1.i386.rpm</filename>).
			If you choose to use the three individual
			files, be sure to
			use the <command>--nodeps</command> option when you unpack the
			RPMs to avoid dependancy errors.

</sect2>

<sect2 ID="speech-synthesizers">
<title>Speech Synthesizers</title>

	<para>
	To produce speech output, you need two things: something to parse the
	information on the screen (Emacspeak), and something to
	produce the sounds you hear as output (a speech synthesizer).
	Emacspeak can use either a hardware or software synthesizer to
	produce sound output.  Software
	synthesizers have the benefit of being either free or very
	inexpensive. Hardware synthesizers can run from $150 to $1600
	or more, but they are typically easier to install than
	software synthesizers.

	<para>
	Support for the DECtalk Express and MultiVoice synthesizers is built into
	Emacspeak.  If you have a synthesizer other than a DECtalk
	Express, you may require additional drivers or "speech
	servers" to get Emacspeak to work with your synthesizer.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Internal DECtalk PC and DECtalk PC2 require a kernel
	driver available from <ulink url=
	"ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/dectalk_pc-0.95.tgz"></ulink>. Installation
	instructions are at <ulink url=
	"ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/dectalk_pc-0.95.README"></ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>
	The DoubleTalk PC and AT, Braille n' Speak, Type n' Speak,
	Braille Lite, Apollo, and Accent synthesizers all require an additional speech server that can be

</sect3>

<sect3 ID="software-synths">
<title>Software synthesizers</title>

	<para>
	If you choose to use a software synthesizer, you must
	make sure your sound card is Linux compatible. In addition, if
	you want to perform any tasks that require a multi-channel
	sound card, such as playing auditory cues when you open or close
	an Emacs buffer, you must make sure that your sound card
	is multi-channel capable.
	</para>

	<para>
	There is a complete list of Linux-compatible sound cards
	available at <ulink url="http://www.alsa-project.org"></ulink>.  In addition, you can
	usually find information on your distribution's web site about which
	sound cards are supported with each distro.
	</para>

	<para>
	Once you have ensured that your sound card is Linux compatible,
	you can install a software synthesizer.  Currently the only
	one that works with Emacspeak is IBM's ViaVoice Text-to-Speech
	(TTS), formerly called ViaVoice Outloud. Many Emacspeak users
	use this software synthesizer, because it is free of
	charge. Instructions for installing ViaVoice can be found in

					If you are getting this error

					</para>
					
					<para>
					The first step is to
					make sure that you have tcl
					correctly installed, as
					explained in the following instructions.
					</para>
		
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							First, make
							sure you are
							in the
							<filename>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers</filename>
							directory.
							</para>
						</listitem>

						<listitem>
							<para>
							At the command
							prompt, type
							<command>tcl
							<replaceable>name
							of speech server</replaceable></command>,
						 	The
							most common
							speech servers are
							<command>dtk-exp</command>
							and
							<command>outloud</command>.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>

					<para>
					If you get an error such as
					<command>bash: tcl:: command
					not found</command>, it means
					that 
					tcl/tclx is not
					correctly installed on your
					system. You must get the
					latest version of either tcl
					or tclx and install it before
					Emacspeak will work.
					</para>

					<para>
					If everything is installed
					correctly, you should hear a
					voice saying "IBM
					ViaVoice. This is Emacspeak"
					or something similar. A
					<command>%</command> command
					prompt should also appear.
					At the prompt, type <command>q "this is
					a test."</command> Then press
					<command>Return</command> and
					type
					<command>d</command>. This command
					runs the speech, so you should
					hear "this is a test"
					spoken. If you hear this,
					the server
					script is running
					properly. You can type
					<command>exit</command> to
					quit tcl.
					</para>
					
					<para>
					You may also get an error like
					<command>stdiosynth executable
					not found</command> when you
					type <command>tcl
					<replaceable>name of speech server</replaceable></command>, and then get a
					command prompt. Testing has
					shown that this error can
					appear even when
					<application>stdiosynth</application>
					is correctly installed and
					Emacspeak is working. Even if
					you get this error message,
					you should still get the
					<command>%</command> command prompt,
					so you should be able to test
					the script.
					</para>

					<para>
					If the script test was unsuccessful,
					(if tcl was found and
					you got a <prompt>%</prompt>
					prompt but you did not hear any
					speech), the next step is to
					make sure that you have the
					correct lines in your
					<filename>profile</filename>
					file to let Emacspeak know
					where to find the
					speech server. To check this,
					follow these steps:
					</para>

					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							Go to your
							<filename>/etc</filename>
							directory,
							then use you
							favorite text
							editor to open the
							file named
							<filename>profile</filename>.
							</para>
						</listitem>

						<listitem>
							<para>
							Make sure the
							following
							lines are in
							the file:
							</para>

							<programlisting>
							export DTK_PROGRAM
							DTK_PROGRAM=<replaceable>name
							of speech server</replaceable>
							</programlisting>

							<para>
							The most
							common speech
							servers, are
							<command>outloud</command>
							and
							<command>dtk-exp</command>.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>
			
					<para>
					If these lines are not in your
					<filename>profile</filename>
					file, add them and then
					re-test tcl. If you are using
					ViaVoice TTS as your
					synthesizer, Emacspeak should
					work correctly at this
					point. If you are using a
					hardware synthesizer and you
					still do not get any sound,
					check to make
					sure that the environment
					variable <varname>DTK_PORT</varname> is set
					correctly in your
					<filename>/etc/profile</filename> file.
					</para>

					<para>
					The variable <varname>DTK_PORT</varname>
					specifies which port your hardware
					sythesizer is plugged into on
					your computer. Under Linux, if
					your synthesizer is plugged
					into com1, you must set
					<varname>DTK_PORT</varname> to
					<filename>/dev/ttyS0</filename>,
					and if it is in com2, then
					<varname>DTK_PORT</varname> should be set to
					<filename>/dev/ttyS1</filename>.
					To set this variable, follow
					these steps:
					</para>

					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							Open your
							<filename>profile</filename>
							file located
							in the
							<filename>/etc</filename>

							</para>
						</listitem>

						<listitem>
							<para>
							Look for the
							variable
							<varname>DTK_PORT</varname>.  If
							this variable does not
							exist, scroll

							file and add
							the following
							line:
							</para>

		<programlisting>
		export DTK_PORT=/dev/ttySX
		</programlisting>

							<para>
							In this line,
							the "X" should

						</listitem>
		
						<listitem>
							<para>
							When you are
							finished, save
							and close the
							<filename>profile</filename>
							file.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>

					<para>
					Finally, retest tcl, and if
					it works, restart Emacspeak.
					Emacspeak should work correctly.
					</para>

					<para>
					If you have a hardware
					synthesizer and are still not
					getting any speech, you probably do
					not have the necessary
					permissions to use the serial
					port for your
					synthesizer. There are a
					number of solutions to this
					problem, and the best solution
					depends on your operating
					environment. For example, if you
					are in a multi-user
					environment, controlling the
					access permissions to the
					serial device may be a
					concern. The options are as follows: 
					</para>
	
					<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
						<listitem>

<title>Appendix A: Installing Linux from a DOS machine</title>
	
	<para>
	In the original Emacspeak HOWTO, James Van Zandt provided
	instructions on how to install Linux from a DOS machine using
	a null-modem cable. As with the other instructions in this
	HOWTO, I tried, unfortunately without success, to duplicate this procedure. However, I have provided the information
	gathered during testing in the following section.  If you
	successfully install Linux from a Windows&trade; or DOS&trade;
	machine over a null-modem cable,
	please let me know the procedure you followed and I'll include
	it here.
	</para>

	<para>
	Please note that the original instructions for
	installing Linux over a null modem cable were written for a
	DOS machine.  I first attempted to reproduce these
	instructions with my Windows 2000 machine (from the DOS prompt) and Red Hat
	7.1.  Although I successfully downloaded and installed
	JAWS for DOS (available from Freedom Scientific at <ulink
	url="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_downloads/morejaws.asp"></ulink>),
	I was unable to get a DOS VT100 terminal emulator installed. I
	tried using TELIX, which was popular several years ago, but
	when I tried to install TELIX version 3.51, I got a runtime
	error. Since I was
	unable to find any other DOS terminal emulators, I decided to
	try using a Windows screenreader and terminal emulator
	instead. This section documents the procedure I tried with the
	Windows machine.
	</para>

<sect2 id="appendix-a-requirements">
<title>Requirments</title>

	<para>
	For this process, you will need a machine with a working
	speech synthesizer and a terminal emulator program. For my
	test, I used a Windows 2000 machine and tried both Narrarator
	(which comes with Windows 2000) and JAWS for Windows
	v.3.5. For the terminal emulator, I used tried both
	Hyperterminal (which comes with Windows) and CRT (which
	can be downloaded from <ulink
	url="http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt"></ulink>). You will also
	need a second machine (on which to install Linux), a null
	modem cable, and a copy of your preferred Linux distribution
	on either floppy disk or CD-ROM. 
	</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="setup">
<title>Connecting the computers</title>

	<para>
	To connect the two computers, you need a "null modem"
	cable.  A "null modem" cable is a serial cable that connects ground to ground
	and transmits on each end to receive on the other.  The cable
	that comes with the DOS application
	<application>LapLink</application> will work fine.  The
	<application>LapLink</application> cable is particularly handy
	because it has both a 9 pin and a 25 pin connector on each
	end.  Alternatively, you may be able to find a null modem
	cable at your local computer store, or you can have one made.
	If you choose to have one made, here are the required connections:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
			For two 9 pin connectors, connect pin 2
			(receive data) to pin 3, pin 3 (transmit data)
			to pin 2, and pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 5.
			</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>
			For two 25 pin connectors, connect pin 2
			(receive data) to pin 3, pin 3 (transmit data)
			to pin 2, and pin 7 (signal ground) to pin 7.
			</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>
			For a 9 pin connector (first) to a 25 pin
			connector (second), connect pin 2 (receive
			data) to pin 2 (transmit data), pin 3
			(transmit data) to pin 3 (receive data), and
			pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 7 (signal
			ground).
			</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	Once you have your null modem cable, you'll need to connect
	the two machines while both of them are off. It's
	easiest to use COM1 on both machines. Once you've got them
	connected, you're ready to start them up, as discussed in the
	next section
	</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="installing">
<title>Installation</title>

	<para>
	Once your machines are connected via the null modem cable, boot the DOS/Windows
	machine, then start the terminal emulation program.  For my
	test, I tried both Hyperterminal (which comes with Windows 2000) and CRT (which
	can be downloaded from <ulink
	url="http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt"></ulink>.
	For some reason, the arrow keys did not work in HyperTerminal,
	making navigation within the HyperTerminal window
	impossible. However, the arrow keys (as well as Tab and
	Return) do work in CRT, so I recommend using CRT as your
	terminal emulator.
	</para>

	<para>
	Set the terminal emulator 
	for 9600 baud, no parity, eight data bits, 1 stop bit. If
	"Flow control" is an option, select Hardware.  Also be sure to
	set your terminal emulation mode to VT100. Start the terminal emulator
	connection (you won't get any data at this point, as your
	Linux machine should still be off).
	</para>

	<para>
	Once you've set up the terminal emulator on your
	DOS/Windows machine, insert the "boot" floppy or CD into
	your Linux machine and boot the machine. With Red Hat, at
	the <prompt>boot:</prompt> prompt, I typed in the
	command <command>linux text console=ttyS0</command>.  Note
	that the "s" in "ttyS0" is capitalized, and that's a "zero" at the end of
	the string, not a capital letter "o." Other distributions may
	require other strings, so if you know the syntax required for
	distros other than Red Hat,
	please let me know and I will include that information here. 
	</para>

	<para>
	Once you've typed in this string at the <prompt>boot:</prompt>
	prompt and hit <command>Return</command>, you should get output in your terminal emulator
	program on your DOS/Windows machine.  Unfortunately, at
	this point I discovered that neither JAWS for Windows
	nor Narrarator produces speech output in either the HyperTerminal or
	CRT terminal windows. This ultimately stymied my attempts to
	install Linux over a null modem cable.
