This document describes how one could quickly test if a new package works
resonably well. The idea was posted on
http://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility/2013/10/msg00026.html

Emacspeak comes with a software synthesiser in the package
emacspeak-espeak-server I recommend to test emacspeak with that
synthesiser to also confirm that that works. If not the case after
installation of emacspeak-espeak-server, you need the following in
/etc/emacspeak.conf:

paul@wollumbin ~ $ cat /etc/emacspeak.conf
# emacspeak configuration file
#
#
if [ "$DTK_PROGRAM" = "" ]; then
DTK_PROGRAM=espeak
fi
if [ "$DTK_TCL" = "" ]; then
DTK_TCL=tcl
fi
if [ "$DTK_PORT" = "" ]; then
DTK_PORT=none
fi
if [ "$DTK_DEVICE" = "" ]; then
DTK_DEVICE="espeak"
fi
export DTK_PROGRAM DTK_PORT DTK_DEVICE
if [ "$DTK_TCL" != "" ]; then export DTK_TCL; fi
# End of /etc/emacspeak.conf

=================

Below you find the contents of the EmacspeakTestingGuide wiki
(https://wiki.debian.org/EmacspeakTestingGuide) as it appeared on 20 June 2014. I
recommend checking that page if there is more up-to-date information
(and update this file if there is).

These are the steps to test whether Emacspeak release (our releases) works
correctly.

Startup

Start Emacspeak using "emacspeak -q" command, that is without launching user
init file. On startup Emacspeak plays a melody and speaks a message "Press
... perfectly". However the melody is only heard when a required mp3 playback
program is present, probably mplayer. So don't worry if you don't hear the
melody, but the message should be there.

Movement

Every movement command should cause the part that was moved by to be
spoken. Try moving with arrows to hear the letters or lines. Try M-f M-b to
hear the words. This may be tested on welcome page.

Vulnerable commands

Try these commands whether they don't cause an unwanted behaviour or errors.

    S-down moves down bypassing empty lines C-right goes to next buffer M-x
    rmail - opens rmail application

Read only message

Create a new buffer, mark it as read only, try to type something. You should
hear: "capital buffer is read hyphen only".

    C-x C-f aaa M-x toggle-read-only type a letter

Info pages

Info pages were not always working correctly. In gui Emacs some of them were
silent. Try movement commands (char, word, line) in 2 info buffers:

    M-: (info "(Emacs)") press Next to go to another info page

Transient mode

Try if transient mark mode works as expected. In some version it did not.

    C-x C-b - select "scratch" buffer with enter key or mouse go to the
    beginning of line 3 C-space - mark the end of selection move to the
    beginning of line 2, line 2 highlights in yellow

    M-x replace-string <enter> t <enter> X <enter>

The letter t should change to X, but only in the second line.

Auditory icons

Auditory icons are funny sounds announcing things happening during edition and
movement.

    C-e C-a - turn them on C-home - icon is played C-spc - another icon is
    played C-/ - undo, yet another icon

Undo

Check if undo bug is present:

    C-x C-f bbb - creates a new buffer Type "12" Go left delete (only "1"
    remains) Type "3" Buffer consists of "13" C-/ - undo, several undo presses
    should make the buffer empty again. The bug caused switching back and forth
    the last change.

Emacspeak version

Test if the version Emacspeak presents is really the one it should be.

    M-: emacspeak-version
