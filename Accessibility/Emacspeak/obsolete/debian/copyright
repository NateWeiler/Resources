   The references to DEC and Adobe are legacy.
   
   Each lisp file clearly states it's not part of Emacs but the same
   licensing rules apply --as far as I am concerned that's GPL.

The original source was repacked by removing the info directory (see
 debian/get-orig-source.sh) as the emacspeak documentation has the

 @c Right now, I am using an invariant license.

The 2013-2016 modifications in debian are done by Paul Gevers <elbrus@debian.org>.
 I consider the debian stuff under the GPL2+ license as the package itself,
 although James R. Van Zandt <jrv@debian.org> never claimed that explicetely.
