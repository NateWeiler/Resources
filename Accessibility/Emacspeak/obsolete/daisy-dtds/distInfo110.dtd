Author: James Pritchett
Change list:
2001-12-06  M. Moodie. Changed content model of changeMsg to eliminate ambiguity.
2002-02-12  M. Moodie. Changed dtd version from 1.0.1 to 1.1.0 per changes in other DTDs.
2002-02-27 M. Moodie. Grammatical changes suggested by editor.

Description:
An XML application to describe the contents of a single piece of DTB
distribution media.  It consists of a list of books to be found on the
media.  For each book, distInfo identifies the location of each book 
within the media filesystem.  If the book is being distributed on multiple 
distribution media (media units), the distInfo book element also includes:
1) the sequence id of this media unit
2) a distribution map for the book, telling where to find all the SMIL files for a book

The following identifiers apply to this DTD: 
"-//NISO//DTD distInfo v1.1.0//EN"

<!-- distInfo:  Root element, consists of one or more books.
"version" specifies the version of this DTD used in this instance. Three 
digits, with decimal point separators; digits one, two and three will 
reflect major, moderate and minor changes, respectively. This attribute 
must be present but parsers will not enforce its presence, just its value.

<!-- book:  a DTB that is present, in part or whole, on this piece of
distribution media.  The uid and pkgRef attributes are required.  "uid"
matches the package unique-identifier.  "pkgRef" is a URI that locates the
book's package file on this media unit.

If this is a book fragment, then the "media" attribute identifies which
fragment is stored on this media unit, and a single distMap element
is present to describe which SMIL files are present on which media units.
The media attribute is in the format "x:y", where x is the sequence
number of this media unit, and y is the total number of media units
in the distribution of this book.

In the case of a book fragment, <book> should contain exactly one 
<distMap> and optionally one or more <changeMsg> elements.

<!-- distMap:  a map identifying which media the various SMIL files
reside upon.  This consists of one or more smilRef elements.  The
distMap smilRefs should match one-to-one those of the book package spine.
-->
<!ELEMENT distMap (smilRef+)>

<!-- smilRef:  a reference to a DTB SMIL file.  These are referenced
by file name. The mediaRef attribute of each smilRef identifies the piece of 
media that the file resides upon, and is in the format "x:y" (see above).

<!-- changeMsg:  A pointer to a custom message to be read when a new disk is
requested by the reading system.  "mediaRef" identifies the media unit which 
this message (e.g., "Insert disc 2") specifies.  Player invokes the correct 
<changeMsg> by matching its "mediaRef" attribute to the "mediaRef" attribute 
of the selected <smilRef>.  "mediaRef" is in the format "x:y", where x is 
the sequence number of the specified media unit, and y is the total number of media 
pieces in the distribution of this book.
