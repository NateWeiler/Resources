<!-- BookmarkSet: The set of bookmarks for a book consists of the title, a unique identifier of the book, the last place the reader left off and zero or more bookmarks, highlights, and associated audio or textual notes. This set is intended for export of bookmarks, highlights and notes to another player; the markup is not required for a player's internal representation of bookmarks.
 -->

<!-- Title: The book's title in text and an optional audio clip.

<!-- Bookmark: Location and optional note. Location consists of a uri pointing to the id attribute of the <par> element in the SMIL file that contains the bookmark plus a time offset in seconds (or character offset) to the exact place.  Player should by default automatically number bookmarks in the order in which they fall in the book.

<!-- NcxRef: Captures current location in NCX (the id of the current navPoint)at time lastmark, bookmark, or highlight is set.  Ensures that current location in NCX and SMIL are synchronized after moving to a lastmark, etc., so that any global navigation commands issued by the user will start from the current location. -->

<!-- Timeoffset: Exact position of bookmark in SMIL file or audio-only file referenced by the uri; in seconds.fraction (seconds=DIGIT+, fraction=3DIGIT).
