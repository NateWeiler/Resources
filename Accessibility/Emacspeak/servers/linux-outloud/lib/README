* Running Outloud/Voxin on 64-Bit Ubuntu 

Install Voxin-1.6 which includes libvoxin.so,
then build linux-outloud/atcleci.so as a 64bit module and profit.


*Legacy: 32-Bit Outloud
32-bit atcleci.so is checked in here for convenience.
This is useful for use on a 64 bit system where you dont have a 32-bit build chain.
To build  atcleci.so on modern  ubuntu systems, you may need 
sudo aptitude install g++-multilib

For getting 32-bit versions of the needed tcl libraries installed, see utility 
getlibs available here:
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=474790
or just install package getlibs on ubuntu
Execute:
sudo aptitude install getlibs 
sudo getlibs -p tcl8.4 tcl8.4-dev tclx8.4 tclx8.4-dev

For Ubuntu Precise, you can first install 
gcc-4.6-base:i386
libstdc++6:i386
and then install the ia32_tcl*.deb packages found on the
emacspeak downloads area, or in svn in this directory.

Then run ldd on the provided atcleci.so and make sure that all
linker dependencies are resolved 
ldd atcleci.so | grep -i found 
should show missing culprits.
