Notes On Using Software Dectalk   (Software TTS) with Emacspeak:

Fonix Software Dectalk TTS (Text To Speech) is a software version of
the Dectalk TTS engine.  This is a text to speech synthesis engine
that allows you to produce synthetic speech from text using a sound
card. Note that Software Dectalk for Linux needs to be purchased from
http://www.fonix.com/products/dectalk/rt_linux/.

* Pre-requisites:

You need to obtain  and install the Fonix Software Dectalk
--the Dectalk TTS engine is a commercial product and 
is not distributed with this package.

 * Installation:

** Is Software Dectalk   Working?

Once you have successfully obtained and install Fonix Software Dectalk 
 for Linux verify that the TTS engine works by running the "say"
 program bundled with the Dectalk TTS engine.

**  Have You Installed Emacspeak?

Before attempting to build and install Software Dectalk 
support for Emacspeak you should first install Emacspeak the
normal way.  See the Emacspeak Makefile for instructions.

** Downloading  Software Dectalk  Support For Emacspeak:

Download and install software-dtk package from the Emacspeak site.
This provides the compiled Emacspeak software dtk server --file servers/software-dtk/tcldtk.so

* Testing:

Next, test that your installation of the Emacspeak Software Dectalk 
support works.  The Dectalk  Outloud speech server is called
dtk-soft  and is installed in the emacspeak/servers  directory along
with other speech servers.

To test this server, do: 
tcl /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers/dtk-soft

 This should speak a welcome message and display a tcl> prompt if all
   is well.
   
* Using Software Dectalk  With Emacspeak:

Proceed to this step *only*
after successfully completing all of the previous steps.
You can either make the Software Dectalk  engine your default
synthesizer by setting environment variable 
DTK_PROGRAM as follows befoer launching Emacs:
export DTK_PROGRAM=dtk-soft

Alternatively,  you can switch to the dtk-soft while
emacspeak is running by 
invoking command dtk-select-server --type
C-e d d ret dtk-soft ret 


Alternatively start emacspeak with the "-d" option.


* Using dtk-soft as the default synthesizer:

Once you've confirmed that everything is working with the
Outloud engine and Emacspeak, you can make dtk-soft your
default synthesizer by:
** If you have emacspeak launched from inside your .emacs:

set variable dtk-program to "dtk-soft" 
before you load emacspeak-setup.el
