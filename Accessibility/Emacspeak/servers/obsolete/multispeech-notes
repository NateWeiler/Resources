Notes On Using Multilingual Speech Server with Emacspeak:

Multispeech is a multilingual speech server. Now it supports English
and Russian. Natively it uses Mbrola and Freephone for English and
Ru_tts for Russian speech synthesis, but can be tuned for using other
TTS engines.

* Pre-requisites:

You need to obtain  and install the Multispeech itself and
accompanying TTS engines. All this stuff is not distributed with this
package and can be downloaded freely from
http://www.mr-blind.hopto.org/blinux/ or
ftp://ftp.rakurs.spb.ru/pub/Goga/.

 * Installation:

**  Have You Installed Emacspeak?

Before attempting to build and install Multispeech
support for Emacspeak you should first install Emacspeak the
normal way.  See the Emacspeak Makefile for instructions.

** Multispeech installation notes:

At first, note that Multispeech is a stand-alone application and it
doesn't need TCL. To use this server with Emacspeak you should make
symlink named "multispeech" pointing to it's executable in the
directory where Emacspeak's speech servers normally live.

You need not to use elisp stuff shipped with the Multispeech. Now it
is incorporated in this package.

* Testing:

To test multispeech, start it from shell and type:

tts_say { some text from your choice }

If the text in braces is spoken then all is ok.

* Using Multispeech  With Emacspeak:

Proceed to this step *only*
after successfully completing all of the previous steps.
You can either make the Multispeech your default
speech server by setting environment variable 
DTK_PROGRAM as follows before launching Emacs:
export DTK_PROGRAM=multispeech

Alternatively,  you can switch to the multispeech while
emacspeak is running by 
invoking command dtk-select-server --type
C-e d d ret multispeech ret 


Alternatively start emacspeak with the "-m" option.


* Using multispeech as the default synthesizer:

Once you've confirmed that everything is working with the
Multispeech and Emacspeak, you can make multispeech your
default synthesizer by:
** If you have emacspeak launched from inside your .emacs:

set variable dtk-program to "multispeech" 
before you load emacspeak-setup.el
