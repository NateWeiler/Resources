Dear Raman,

I finally cleaned up the code and wrote the documentation for the
emacspeak real-time feature plugin. I call it emacspeak-queue for the
time being. Please read the readme file and test it once you have
time. It works very well with my Voxin( viavoice outloud) tts server.
I think it will also work with other servers. Please test it with your
voxin laptop first. Thank you! Please let me know if you have any
questions or suggestions for this plugin.

Sincerely,
Qianli Liao
