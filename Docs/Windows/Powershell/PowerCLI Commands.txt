--------------  EXAMPLE 1 --------------

    C:\PS>Connect-VIServer -Server 10.23.112.235 -Protocol https -User NateWeiler
    -Password $Hustle4$
    Connects to a vSphere server using the User and Password parameters.
    --------------  EXAMPLE 2 --------------

    C:\PS>Connect-VIServer Server -Credentials $myCredentialsObject -Port 1234
    Connects to a vSphere server by using a credential object.

    --------------  Example 3 --------------

    C:\PS>Connect-VIServer "Server" -SessionId $sessionId

    Connect by using a server session ID.
    Once you connect to a server, you can save the session ID -
    $serverObject.SessionId, so that you can restore the existing server
    connection instead of reconnecting.

   --------------  Example 4 --------------

    C:\PS>Connect-VIServer Server

   Connect by using integrated authentication. In this case, the credentials
   you are logged on to your machine must be the same as those for the server

    --------------  Example 5 --------------

C:\PS>Connect-VIServer "Server" -User user -Password pass -SaveCredentials
    Connect to a server and save the credentials in the credential store.
    After the credentials are stored, you can connect to the server without
    specifying them. To get a previously saved credential store item, use the
    Get-VICredentialStoreItem cmdlet.

    -------------- Example 6 --------------

    C:\PS>Connect-VIServer –Menu

    Connect to a server by choosing the server address from a list of
    Previously connected servers.

    -------------- Example 7 --------------

    C:\PS>Connect-VIServer "Server" -All Linked

    Connect to a vSphere server which is a part of a federation vCenter
    Server. This will connect you to all vSphere servers in the federation as
	
Connect-VIServer -Server 192.168.200.205
