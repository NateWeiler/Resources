# Documentation Migration

The docs folder in this repo contains a lot of documentation about the PowerShell source code and build environment.
It also has contained documentation about installing and using PowerShell.
That documentation belongs in the [PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs) repo.

We are in the process of migrating the user-focused articles to the docs repo.
This file records which files have been migrated.
