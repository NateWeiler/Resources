If there are arguments: 
 
* If -, -c, or r is used, all arguments are placed in sys.argv[1:...] and sys.argv[0] is set to '', '-c', or '-r'.  No editor window is opened, even if that is the default set in the Options dialog. 
* Otherwise, arguments are files opened for editing and sys.argv reflects the arguments passed to IDLE itself.
