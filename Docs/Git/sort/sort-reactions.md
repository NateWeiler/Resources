A userscript that sorts comments by reaction

* The userscript adds a block of buttons under the first post.
  * The sort block is not visible when an issue has less than 2 reactions.
  * Block Avatar:
    * The initial avatar shows an up & down arrow to indicate no default reaction or sort is applied.
    * Clicking on this avatar will toggle the view of the reaction selection block.
    * Once you choose a reaction from the block, it becomes your set preference and the block avatar.
    * A small round sort icon will appear in the bottom right corner. Clicking on it will change the sort.
  * Clicking on a sort reaction button or avatar sort icon will sort the comments by the selected reaction: "+1", "-1", "laugh", "hooray", "confused" and "heart".
  * One extra button is included (speak no evil üôä monkey):
    * Clicking it will sort the comments using a calculated value based on all reactions for that comment.
    * The calculated values are as follows: "üëç", "üéâ" &amp; "‚ù§Ô∏è" = `+1`; "üòÑ" = `+0.5`; "üòï" = `-0.5`; "üëé" = `-1`.
  * The first click applies a descending sort, the second an ascending sort and the third click restores the comment order.
  * Comments without a reaction and comments with the same (calculated) number of reactions will be added depending on its original order ([stable sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability)).
* Progressively loaded comments:
  * The "load more comments" button will be moved to the top, immediately under the sort block. For easy access.
  * New comments are supposed to be included in the sort, but you may need to resort the column anyway. I'll troubleshoot the mutations script and fix this soon.
