## Where do I report an issue?

Reporting an issue would be better done in the [issues section](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/issues) of this repository. Posting the problem on Greasy Fork, or other userscript hosting site would delay my response and resolution of the issue because I usually only check those sites after updating a userscript.

Also, check the [[known issues]] page and search the [issues](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/issues) to make sure the problem isn't already known.

## What if I am requesting an enhancement?

Enhancement requests should also be added to the [issues section](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/issues) of this repository. Implementation of the request may or may not be possible; and if it is a feasible request, the time until implementation may vary.

## When will a userscript be included in [Octopatcher](https://github.com/Mottie/Octopatcher)?

If a userscript becomes popular enough, and I have the time, I'll add it to the web extension. It takes a bit of modification to convert a userscript into an extension content script &ndash; mostly due to adding options to the options page.

Right now, I need to generalize this process a bit more to make conversion easier. Then I can convert a large bulk of userscripts.

## Where do you get your ideas?

Some of my ideas come from everyday use of GitHub and thinking, "This page needs &#x5f;&#x5f;&#x5f;&#x5f;&#x5f;...".

A lot of ideas come from other users. Especially from:
  * https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues
  * https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues
  * https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/issues

## Do you take donations?

I am not actively seeking donations, but if you feel like you *have to*, then use [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=Brv96e_d75QWBy9_bCLORhx2gQ8OEx0arMNWOKT_yIM-vimbfAtUZcHoPmEHjOjGg6ipbG&country.x=US&locale.x=US). And thanks!
