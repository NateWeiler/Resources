# If you plan to develop Matplotlib and run or add to the test suite,

[gui_support]
# Matplotlib supports multiple GUI toolkits, including
# GTK3, MacOSX, Qt4, Qt5, Tk, and WX. Support for many of
# these toolkits requires AGG, the Anti-Grain Geometry library,
# which is provided by Matplotlib and built by default.
#
# Some backends are written in pure Python, and others require
# extension code to be compiled. By default, Matplotlib checks for
# these GUI toolkits during installation and, if present, compiles the
# required extensions to support the toolkit.
#
# - Tk support requires Tk development headers and Tkinter.
# - Mac OSX backend requires the Cocoa headers included with XCode.
# - Windowing is MS-Windows specific, and requires the "windows.h"
#   header.
#
# The other GUI toolkits do not require any extension code, and can be
# used as long as the libraries are installed on your system --
# therefore they are installed unconditionally.
#
# You can uncomment any the following lines to change this
# behavior. Acceptable values are:
#
#     True: build the extension. Exits with a warning if the
#           required dependencies are not available
#     False: do not build the extension
#     auto: build if the required dependencies are available,
#           otherwise skip silently. This is the default
#           behavior
