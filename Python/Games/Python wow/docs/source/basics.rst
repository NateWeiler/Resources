Starting out
============

When first starting the game, you're prompted to create a new character.
Immediately after creation, you're popped into the world and the monsters are shown.
You have the choice to type "?" to see all available commands or engage an attack on a monster with
    engage {monsterName}
You swing at the monster using the
    attack
command and all is well. Once you kill the monster, loot drops from it.
    Loot dropped:
        3 gold
        
        Wolf Meat - Miscellaneous Item
        
        Wolf Pelt - Miscellaneous Item
        
        Strength Potion - Potion (Increases strength by 15 for 5 turns.)
You can take specific items with the
    take {itemName}
command, take everything with the
    take all
command or simply exit the menu, using the (you guessed it)
    exit
command.

But enough about the action of playing the game, we can go on forever with that, let's see how it works under the hood.
