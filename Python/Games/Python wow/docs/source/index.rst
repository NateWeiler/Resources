Welcome to python_wow's documentation!
======================================

What is python_wow?
===================
python_wow is a console turn-based RPG game written in Python 3. It is inspired by the Warcraft universe.
The game works through user text commands. The goal with this pet project is to create a somewhat
complex game with good code structure, tests and documentation but most important of all: to learn how to
handle a project bigger than 500 lines of code.
python_wow does not use pygame/rpeg intentionally, the motive being to see how far I can go writing my own RPG logic.
