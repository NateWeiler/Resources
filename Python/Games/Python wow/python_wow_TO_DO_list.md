# Low Priority TODOs
- Add more content(monster, zone/subzones, npcs, items, vendors, spells and etc)
- Add list with last twenty prints, clear the console and rewrite again whenever a command has been added
- Add Talents System

# Small TODOs
- Print Stats (hp, mana, xp and everything else at once)
- Add item gossip text 
- Convert the equipment dictionary to a class

# TODOs
- Refactor code from classes to make it more testable. Split functions which do not touch the class attributes. ex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu5EhKVZdV8&t=22m30s
- Add documentation!
- Add another class of choice. (Mage is on my mind)
- Add a scripted NPC to the game
- Implement HoTs (heal over time effects)
- Add NatureHeal
- Add different kinds of damage
- Create more damage classes, each with it's own flavour. (Destruction leaves off a DoT, Sinister has a chance to strike again, Merciless has a chance to crit and others without flavor (holy, frost, fire etc))
- fix up private and protected vars/methods
