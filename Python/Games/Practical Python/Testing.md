##    Testing
The app was tested on an ongoing basis. Chrome and Chrome Developer Tools were the primary browser and tool used for testing. However, the site was also tested using Firefox and Internet Explorer.

*   CSS was validated using the **CSS Validation Service** provided by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
*   Python code has no pep8 issues

<a name="during"></a>
### During development:
*  **print()** was used extensively for viewing returned data and testing.
*  I created a 'debug panel' in each html template. This panel contained the values of all the variables set
in run.py. It helped me monitor the values as I tested the app in a browser to ensure the correct values were being set.

    ![Debug Panel](static/img/readme_images/debug_panel1.png)|
*   When I wanted to try something new, I saved run.py to the previous_versions folder in the route of my project.
I would continue to develop and refer back to the folder if I needed to quickly revert to or reference code from a previous version.
I realise I could have used git or git branches, but most of the previous_versions files were trial and error, mostly error.
*	Div’s had vibrant background colours so that the developer was easily able to identify them 
*	Each css or html update was viewed in a chrome browser and tested using developer tools at full width resolution and using a variety of device emulators; Galaxy SIII, Galaxy 5, Laptop touch screen, iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad. 
*	Remote debugging using Android, Windows OS and Chrome Dev Tools was used to test each new functionality and new/updated page.

### Development/Defensive Design Testing
Testing was carried out continuously while developing the app. 
As per the Defensive Design Strategy described in the Strategy Plan, all form inputs are checked for empty values. Users are messaged if they click a submit button without providing text.
Users are also informed by an on-screen text if their answer was correct or incorrect. 

Custom 404 and 500 error pages were created. These were implemented to give players a friendly error feedback if something errored or a page was not found.

#### Logging in
*check_username()*

This function checks if the username entered is already taken or in session so that user can start/restart/resume a game.

*_The Session takes precedence over the usernames List._*

*   If a new player is _not_ in the usernames list and _does not_ have an active session they enter a username and can continue on to play the game.
*   If a person _is in_ the usernames list and _does not_ have an active session they must enter a new username and can continue on to play the game.
*   If a person _is not_ in the usernames list and _does_ have an active session they can enter their username and continue on to play/restart/resume the game.
*   If a person _is in_ the usernames list but _does not_ have an active session they are asked to choose a different username

## Usability Testing
During usability testing, 
*   **Testers commented that the player name input box on the start page was not very obvious.** 
    <br>I redesigned the start page to make the input field more obviously an input field, and I changed the help button to a hyperlink with a font awesome icon. This made the submit button the only button on the page.
*   **Testers noticed that the lowercase version of an answer wasn’t accepted.**<br> So I added .lower() function to the function that gets the player response.

*   **Testers were frustrated at**
    *   not being able to log back into the game with the same user name, 
    *   resume a game after visiting the leader board or 
    *   resume a game after logging back in

As a result the code was overhauled to add these player abilities

##   Final Testing and Resolutions

With every code change no matter how small the app was tested in the browser. My Debug Panel gave me real time feedback on when and 
how my variables, lists and dictionaries were being updated.
Dev Tools in Chrome were used to update the css.
Dev Tools Console was monitored for errors.
But above all the terminal in cloud9 was the primary source of feedback. Variable values were print() to ensure they were being set and their values monitored.

Approximately half way through the project, unittests were written. These were run periodically throughout development.
They were updated to reflect any refactoring of the main run.py code.

Refactoring and moving large chunks of code into their own function was an ongoing process. As a result the unittests were updated to reflect these changes.
New unittests were added when new functions were created in run.py

<a name="res"></a>
### Resolutions
Following user testing by slack members a major overhaul was undertaken to resolve the issue around users being unable to resume a game.
check_username() was rewritten to assess whether a user still had an active session or still in the usernames list.
If they were returning players with a game in session, then the code was written to access their player data in the player_info list and
they were returned to the last riddle they were attempting.

This same approach was used to fix the issue where users could not resume a game after visiting the leader board.
As player data was being stored in a dictionary throughout the duration of a game, it made sense to use this data to track what riddle a
player was answering at any one time.

***

The next major bug was, where multiple players could not play at the same time. This issue was replicated by playing a game at the same time by
two different players in two different browsers. Different browsers were used to ensure that sessions did not overlap.
This issue was the most difficult to resolve. 

Printing out the value of 'riddle' in the check() function was the only way to monitor the exact riddle that was being passed as 
the _next_ riddle. I discovered that by using **global** riddle, the same riddle was being passed to all players.
By putting the value of the current riddle number in a hidden field on the form on play.html, I could pass that riddle number back to the server.
This meant that the riddle number was unique to each player and not dependant upon the **global** riddle number.
This solved my multiple player issue.

### Issues Update
|Issue|Page|Ongoing|
|:---|:---|:---|
|SyntaxWarning: name 'riddle' is assigned to before global declaration|Terminal|resolved|
Solution: I was declaring global riddle too many times in a function. It just needed to be called once at the start

|Issue|Page|Ongoing|
|:---|:---|:---|
|First, Next, Last riddle message not working|play|resolved|

Solution: I needed to put an |int() filter on a variable in the html {% if riddle.Number|int() < length_of_riddles|int() %}

|Issue|Page|Ongoing|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Riddle x of 10 - numbering starts at 0|play|resolved|
Solution: I needed to add 1 to the riddle number as they matched the list index, beginning at 0. riddle.number+1

|Issue|Page|Ongoing|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Multiple instance of user score being displayed|play|resolved
|Multiple instance of user attempts being displayed|play|resolved
Solution: I had been creating a new player in player_info list when a user resumed a game. I rewrote the if statememt to stop this happening.

|Issue|Page|Ongoing|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Multiple players playing simunltaneously affect each other. If Player A gets a riddle correct, Player B is told their correct answer is incorrect|play|resolved
Solution: this was solved by adding a hidden field to the play.html form. It tracked the player riddle number rather than a global riddle number. This stopped 
cross over between players sharing a global variable but rather they had their own way to track their number.

    Confirmed
    
**User Test scenario - 06** Number answers

A helper function called number_to_string() was created. It accepted the player answer.
If the player answer was a digit it was passed to number_to_string(). 
number_to_string() changed the answer to a string e.g. 7 to seven and it was compared to the correct riddle answer.
If the number was not list, the number was returned as a string.


    1.  Player logs in
    2.  Player begins a game
    3.  Player answers a riddle requiring either a string number or digit answer
    4.  Players answer is accepted, checked and the app responds with feedback
    
    Confirmed digit or string accepted
