# Strazoloid Developer Documentation

## Welcome

Strazoloid. Ever want to make multi-window pygame applications?
ever want to copy those simulation games that used virtual window managers?
Well with Strazoloid, you can!

Strazoloid handles all the event, rendering, and thread-multiplexing needed to
properly run a virtual window manager in pygame. However, it is a __framework__, So
you need to write your application around it. 

The following documentation and the
test code provided, should provide you with more than enough information to get started.
