3.0a
added stores, save/load game ability, few other things

3.0
started from scratch, writing Dragon Hunt in Python this time,
as 1) I don't have a Visual Basic compiler anymore, and 2) I
am running Linux now, making it difficult for me to run one in
any case, and 3) I needed to learn Python. Features are about
the same as 2.0, though there are a few improvements that came
along for the ride, along with a few incomplete areas.
