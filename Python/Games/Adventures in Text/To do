To do

- have dynamic container and room descriptions so that they can return something about the objects inside them
- better way to set room exits when initializing
- grammar
    - have support for more than four-word actions
    - use lambdas or mapping instead of list comprehensions
    - less hardcoded, more intelligent processing
- serialise/deserialise
    - all objects are checked against base game (assumes that no objects get created or destroyed -- might want to change)
- dynamic room class creation?
- rewrite game_site so that it doesn't connect and disconnect to/from the database before/after every request
