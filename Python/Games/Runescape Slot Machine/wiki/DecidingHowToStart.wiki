= Introduction =

Upon developing a unique algorithm to automatically explore the odds of gambling, I decided the best way I could put it to the test was by creating my own gambling game.

However, I came across a few problems, and questions that I needed to answer and/or solve myself first.


*Problems I needed to Solve*
  * (problem): Nobody wants to risk their money.
  * (problem): Nobody wants to play for free.
  * (answer): "People want to risk fake money, because they won't be playing for free. So why not use a virtual currency that is easily accessible, and that is used quite frequently?"


*Questions I needed to Answer*
  * (question): Where do I find a virtual currency that is used daily?
  * (answer): "How about a game!? Runescape for instance, everyone plays that, and they are always taking risks to make money!"
