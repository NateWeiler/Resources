                !python
                def log(self, message, level='notice'):
                    if self.logger and not callable(self.logger):
                        raise ValueError(u"Invalid logger set, must be a callable")
        
                    if self.verbose and self.logger:
                        self.logger(message, level)

        Formatting
        ==========
        
        Markdown
        --------
        
        -  Your Markdown source files must be suffixed by ``.md``, ``.markdn``,
           ``.mdwn``, ``.mdown`` or ``.markdown``
        -  To create a title slide, render a single ``h1`` element (eg.
           ``# My Title``)
        -  Separate your slides with a horizontal rule (``---`` in markdown)
           except at the end of md files
        -  Your other slides should have a heading that renders to an ``h1``
           element
        -  To highlight blocks of code, put ``!lang`` where ``lang`` is the
           pygment supported language identifier as the first indented line
        
        ReStructuredText
        ----------------
        
        -  Your ReST source files must be suffixed by ``.rst`` or ``.rest``
           (**``.txt`` is not supported**)
        -  Use headings for slide titles
        -  Separate your slides using an horizontal rule (``----`` in RST)
           except at the end of RST files
        
        Textile
        -------
        
        -  Separate your slides using ``---``, just like in markdown

        Presentation Configuration
        ==========================
        
        Darkslide allows to configure your presentation using a ``cfg``
        configuration file, therefore easing the aggregation of source
        directories and the reuse of them across presentations. Darkslide
        configuration files use the ``cfg`` syntax. If you know ``ini`` files,
        you get the picture. Below is a sample configuration file:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [darkslide]
            ; the old [landslide] is still supported
            theme  = /path/to/my/beautiful/theme
            source = 0_my_first_slides.md
                     a_directory
                     another_directory
                     now_a_slide.markdown
                     another_one.rst
            destination = myWonderfulPresentation.html
            css =    my_first_stylesheet.css
                     my_other_stylesheet.css
            js =     jquery.js
                     my_fancy_javascript.js
            relative = True
            linenos = inline
        
        Don't forget to declare the ``[darkslide]`` section. All configuration
        files must end in the .cfg extension.
        
        To generate the presentation as configured, just run:
        
        ::
        
            $ cd /path/to/my/presentation/sources
            $ darkslide config.cfg
        
        Macros
        ======
        
        You can use macros to enhance your presentation:
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        Add notes to your slides using the ``.notes:`` keyword, eg.:
        
        ::
        
            # My Slide Title
        
            .notes: These are my notes, hidden by default
        
            My visible content goes here
        
        You can toggle display of notes by pressing the ``2`` key.
        
        Some other macros are also available by default: ``.fx: foo bar`` will
        add the ``foo`` and ``bar`` classes to the corresponding slide ``<div>``
        element, easing styling of your presentation using CSS.
        
        QR Codes
        --------
        
        Add a QR Code to your presentation by using the ``.qr`` keyword:
        
        ::
        
            .qr: 450|https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide
        
        Footnote
        --------
        
        Add footnote to the current and all the following presentations
        
        ::
        
            .footnote: Slides available at https://blog.ionelmc.ro/presentations/
        
        
        Presenter Notes
        ===============
        
        You can also add presenter notes to each slide by following the slide
        content with a heading entitled "Presenter Notes". Press the 'p' key to
        open the presenter view.
        
        Registering Macros
        ==================
        
        Macros are used to transform the HTML contents of your slide.
        
        You can register your own macros by creating ``darkslide.macro.Macro``
        derived classes, implementing a ``process(content, source=None)`` method
        and returning a tuple containing the modified contents and some css
        classes you may be wanting to add to your slide ``<div>`` element. For
        example:
        
        ::
        
            !python
            import darkslide
        
            class MyMacro(darkslide.Macro):
              def process(self, content, source=None):
                return content + '<p>plop</p>', ['plopped_slide']
        
            g = darkslide.generator.Generator(source='toto.md')
            g.register_macro(MyMacro)
            print g.render()
        
        This will render any slide as below:
        
        ::
        
            !html
            <div class="slide plopped_slide">
              <header><h2>foo</h2></header>
              <section>
                <p>my slide contents</p>
                <p>plop</p>
              </section>
            </div>
        
        Advanced Usage
        ==============
        
        Setting Custom Destination File
        -------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            $ darkslide slides.md -d ~/MyPresentations/presentation.html
        
        Working with Directories
        ------------------------
        
        ::
        
            $ darkslide slides/
        
        Working with Direct Output
        --------------------------
        
        ::
        
            $ darkslide slides.md -o | tidy
        
        Using an Alternate Darkslide Theme
        ----------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            $ darkslide slides.md -t mytheme
            $ darkslide slides.md -t /path/to/theme/dir
        
        Embedding Base-64-Encoded Images
        --------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            $ darkslide slides.md -i
        
        Enabling Markdown Extensions
        ----------------------------
        
        See documentation on available Markdown extensions
        `here <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/index.html>`__:
        
        ::
        
            $ darkslide slides.md -x abbr
        
        Theming
        -------
        
        A Darkslide theme is a directory following this simple structure:
        
        ::
        
            mytheme/
            |-- base.html
            |-- css
            |   |-- print.css
            |   `-- screen.css
            `-- js
                `-- slides.js
        
        If a theme does not provide HTML and JS files, those from the default
        theme will be used. CSS is not optional.
        
        Widescreen 16x9
        ---------------
        
        You can create widescreen 16x9 slides using the ``--mod=wide16x9`` option.
        
        **NOTE:** The ``--mod=wide16x9`` option causes the files in Darkslide's ``themes/wide16x9/``
        directory to supersede the corresponding files in Darkslide's ``themes/default/``
        directory before the selected theme (if any) is applied.
        
        User stylesheets and Javascripts
        ================================
        
        If you don't want to bother making your own theme, you can include your
        own user css and js files to the generated presentation.
        
        This feature is only available if you use a Darkslide configuration
        file, by setting the ``css`` and/or ``js`` flags:
        
        ::
        
            [darkslide]
            ; the old [landslide] is still supported
            theme  = /path/to/my/beautiful/theme
            source = slides.mdown
            css =    custom.css
            js =     jquery.js
                     powerpoint.js
        
        These will link the ``custom.css`` stylesheet and both the ``jquery.js``
        and ``powerpoint.js`` files within the ``<head>`` section of the
        presentation html file.
        
        **NOTE:** Paths to the css and js files must be relative to the
        directory you're running the ``darkslide`` command from.
        
        Publishing your Presentation Online
        ===================================
        
        For online publishing use the ``--embed`` option to produce a standalone
        HTML file with no dependencies::
        
            $ darkslide slides.md --embed
        
        Theme Variables
        ===============
        
        The ``base.html`` must be a `Jinja2 template
        file <http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/templates>`__ where you can
        harness the following template variables:
        
        -  ``css``: the stylesheet contents, available via two keys, ``print``
           and ``screen``, both having:
        -  a ``path_url`` key storing the url to the asset file path
        -  a ``contents`` key storing the asset contents
        -  ``js``: the javascript contents, having:
        -  a ``path_url`` key storing the url to the asset file path
        -  a ``contents`` key storing the asset contents
        -  ``slides``: the slides list, each one having these properties:
        -  ``header``: the slide title
        -  ``content``: the slide contents
        -  ``number``: the slide number
        -  ``embed``: is the current document a standalone one?
        -  ``num_slides``: the number of slides in current presentation
        -  ``toc``: the Table of Contents, listing sections of the document.
           Each section has these properties available:
        -  ``title``: the section title
        -  ``number``: the slide number of the section
        -  ``sub``: subsections, if any
        
        Styles Scope
        ============
        
        -  To change HTML5 presentation styles, tweak the ``css/screen.css``
           stylesheet bundled with the theme you are using
        -  For printing, modify the ``css/print.css``

        Darkslide v5.1.0 (2020-01-13)
        =============================
        
        * Added support for embedding webfonts.
          Contributed by Emmanuel Ohayon in `#17 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/pull/17>`_.
        * Refactored user css and js path processing code.
        * Relativized user css and js paths to the configuration directory (CWD if there's no configuration file).
        
        Darkslide v5.0.2 (2019-12-07)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed a small bug in the image embedding feature (image detection in CSS file
          could fail).
        
        Darkslide v5.0.1 (2019-10-01)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed media for user css to be always be ``all``. Previously it was ``screen, projection`` if embedded.
        
        Darkslide v5.0.0 (2019-09-29)
        =============================
        
        * Removed PDF export support. You should just use the PDF export from
          Google Chrome (it works way better than the alternatives).
        * Fixed transitions in presenter mode.
        * Added support for Up/Down arrow navigation.
          Contributed by Heiko Schlittermann in `#13 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/pull/13>`_.
        * Added support for Markdown 3.0+ and Textile 2.3+.
        * Changed the broken ``.notes:`` macro to output presenter notes.
        
        Darkslide v4.0.1 (2017-10-19)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed print css a bit.
        * Fixed missing scrolling to current when changing slides while in overview mode.
        
        Darkslide v4.0.0 (2017-10-17)
        =============================
        
        * Dropped MathJax support. Something less to maintain (also, didn't work as expected with ``--embed``). User that need this
          should just use the ``user_js`` option. Or a custom theme.
        * Changed themes to use a space-adjusted Alegreya Sans as a fallback.
        
        Darkslide v3.2.0 (2017-10-17)
        =============================
        
        * Changed themes to use Rosario as a fallback. For better or worse it's smaller and has same width as Candara.
        
        
        Darkslide v3.1.0 (2017-10-17)
        =============================
        
        * Changed themes to embed a Candara fallback webfont (Alegreya Sans). It's slightly narrower but looks more similar than the other
          alternatives better matching Candara's width (Acme, Galdeano). It even has ligatures.
        
        Darkslide v3.0.1 (2017-10-15)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed slightly broken slide class changing.
        * Made expose mode scroll to current slide.
        * Running presenter mode with no target won't break
          anymore if target window is gone.
        * Fixed display of presenter notes.
        
        Darkslide v3.0.0 (2017-10-05)
        =============================
        
        * Removed "expanded mode". It was too buggy and doesn't really have a purpose.
        * Changed "show context" to be "show next slide" (so two slides at a time). This is way more useful than showing little
          bits of next and prev slides.
        * Fixed ``--direct`` on Python 3.
        * Fixed glitches when TOC/Help are open.
        * Made possible to switch slides when TOC/Help/Overview are open.
        
        Darkslide v2.3.3 (2016-05-15)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed height of QR svg elements.
        
        Darkslide v2.3.2 (2016-04-12)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed underline occlusion shadows in the footer (for links).
        * Fixed missing `presenter_notes` class not being set when notes mode was on.
        
        Darkslide v2.3.1 (2016-02-08)
        =============================
        
        * MathJax is loaded on HTTPS.
        
        Darkslide v2.3.0 (2016-02-07)
        =============================
        
        * The Darkslide version is shown in the help sidebar.
        
        Darkslide v2.2.1 (2015-10-06)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed config file parsing for math_output.
        
        Darkslide v2.2.0 (2015-10-06)
        =============================
        
        * Now macro failures abort rendering. Previously they would just log a message that you'd probably woulnd't notice.
        * Fixed broken handling where you have css/js in the cfg file.
        * Allowed setting the math_output option in the cfg file.
        * Fixed encoding issues in the QR macro.
        * Added back the old theme with completely black background (as "void").
        * Tweak the faux underlines to look better.
        
        Darkslide v2.1.0 (2015-10-05)
        =============================
        
        * Added demo links.
        * Fixed options handling. Options from command line now will actually work if a cfg file is used.
        * Corrected relative paths handling:
        
          - paths in sources are now relative to the cfg file (previously they were relative to whatever was cwd).
          - relative option now correctly works when destination file is not in cwd.
        * Fixed layout of slides with many headering (no more paddings for headings, all root elements are spread out evenly
          anyway).
        * Fixed bad styling of ToC (and probably other things in the sidebar).
        * Fixed ToC links (contributed by Cyrille Pontvieux).
        
        Darkslide v2.0.4 (2015-09-09)
        =============================
        
        * Improved handling for filenames that have non-ascii characters in them.
        
        Darkslide v2.0.3 (2015-09-08)
        =============================
        
        * Fixed handling for filenames that have non-ascii characters in them.
        
        Darkslide v2.0.2 (2015-07-20)
        =============================
        
        - Added color classes in the abyss theme.
        - Fixed link underlines in the presenter notes.
        
        Darkslide v2.0.1 (2015-07-19)
        =============================
        
        * Don't use Monaco in the ``base.css`` - it's way bigger than Consolas and the other fonts. And Consolas is nice enough.
        
        Darkslide v2.0.0 (2015-07-17)
        =============================
        
        - Fix display of RST image target links.
        - Add cmd line option to print version.
        - Rewrote the default theme (solarized colors)
        - Overhauled the abyss theme, improved the coloring.
        - Removed all the other themes (they are ugly and broken anyway) (**backwards incompatible**).
        - Fixes for print css.
        - Added support for two new css files: ``base.css`` and ``theme.css``. This
          makes reusing styles acros themes and kinds of display (print/screen) more easy.
        - Expanded mode is now activated by default.
        - Changed macros to use compiled regexes.
        - Added a footnote macro.
        - Changed QR macro to use ``qrcode`` library. Now it's rendered to SVG. The size is removed (**backwards incompatible**).
        
        Darkslide v1.2.2 (2015-05-22)
        =============================
        
        - Fix the blank page issue when generating pdfs (via Chrome's pdf printer).
        
        Darkslide v1.2.1 (2015-05-21)
        =============================
        
        - Couple minor improvements to Abyss theme.
        
        Darkslide v1.2.0 (2015-05-19)
        =============================
        
        - Modifier keys flag was not cleared propertly (kb shortcuts were not working anymore after
          alt-tab etc); now it's cleared on visibility changes and focus loss.
        - Changed expanded mode to automatically hide the context.
        - Fixed window resize flickering (for every resize event the expaded flag was toggled).
        - Disabled context hiding in presenter view.
        - Other small styling improvements.
        - Added "abyss" theme.
