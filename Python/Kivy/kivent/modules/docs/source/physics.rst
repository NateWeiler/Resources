The Cymunk Module
*****************
**These classes have cdefed functions that cannot be read by 
Sphinx. Read the source if you want to find out more about using them.**

This module extends the base functionality of KivEnt by integrating it with 
the Chipmunk2d Physics engine. This will allow you to perform complex 
collision detection and real-time 2d physics calculations on large numbers of
entities simultaneously.
