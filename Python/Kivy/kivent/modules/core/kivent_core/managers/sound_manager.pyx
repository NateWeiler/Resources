    The SoundManager provides additional features on top of Kivy's Sound and
    SoundLoader classes, making it easier for you to integrate sounds into
    your game, and controlling the ability to play the same sound multiple
    times simultaneously.

    **Attributes:**
        **music_volume** (NumericProperty): The master volume from 0.0 to 1.0
        for music tracks.

        **sound_volume** (NumericProperty): The master volume from 0.0 to 1.0
        for sounds. Will be multiplied by the specified volume.

        **cutoff** (NumericProperty): If volume is below this level the sound
        will not be played at all.

        **current_track** (StringProperty): The name of the music track
        currently playing.

        **loop_music** (BooleanProperty): If True when one music track finishes
        playing another will be randomly chosen from the loaded music tracks
        and scheduled for playing between 0 and **max_wait_for_music** seconds
        from now.

        **max_wait_for_music** (NumericProperty): The maximum amount of time
        to wait before automatically playing another music track when
        **loop_music** is True.
        
        **music_dict** (dict): Dictionary containing all tracks loaded
        by **load_music**.
