This is the base for creating a GameSystem usable from python. It will
store the components in a python list and allow dynamic control of your
components data as it is just a python object. These type of GameSystem
do not store their memory as contiguously as the more optimized game systems
but are perfectly suitable for prototyping or game systems that simply do not
do that much processing.

    GameSystem is the part of your game that holds the logic to operate
    on the data of your Entity's components. It will also manage assembling,
    cleaning up, storing, and destroying the components holding system data.
    The basic GameSystem keeps track of **Component**, which is a
    regular Python object supporting all the dynamic nature of python but
    without many static optimizations.
    The basic setup is that we will create a Component object and release them
    for garbage collection when the entity is done. We will avoid resizing the
    components list by reusing space in the list (a component will be cleared
    to None when removed and an internal free list will provide these spaces
    before growing the list).

    **Attributes:**
        **system_id** (StringProperty): Name of this gamesystem, used to name
        entity component attribute, and refer to system.

        **system_index** (NumericProperty): The integer index of the GameSystem
        in the SystemManager array. Corresponds to where in the entity array
        you will find this system's component_index.

        **updateable** (BooleanProperty): Boolean to let gameworld know
        whether or not to run an update tick on this gamesystem. Defaults to
        False

        **paused** (BooleanProperty): Boolean used to determine whether or not
        this system should be updated on the current tick,
        if updateable is True

        **gameworld** (ObjectProperty): Reference to the gameworld object,
        usually bound in kv

        **gameview** (StringProperty): Name of the GameView this system will
        be rendered too. If set to None the system will instead be rendered
        to GameWorld's canvas. The default value is None

        **update_time** (NumericProperty): The 'tick' rate of this system's
        update. Defaults to 1./60. or 60 FPS

        **components** (list): a list of the components currently active.
        If the list contains None at an index that component has been recently
        released for GC and a free list is being maintained internally. Skip
        these values during processing.

        **frame_time** (float): Leftover time from the last update, not consumed
        yet.

        **do_allocation** (BooleanProperty): Determines whether GameWorld
        should run the **allocate** function of the GameSystem during GameWorld
        allocation.

        **do_components** (BooleanProperty): Indicates whether the GameSystem
        will actually have components and thus have a slot reserved for storing
        the component in the EntityManager array.

        **zones** (ListProperty): Determines which zones will be present in the
        GameSystem's memory allocation. Unused in the default GameSystem
        implementation.
