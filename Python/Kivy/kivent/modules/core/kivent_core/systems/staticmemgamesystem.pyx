cdef class StaticMemGameSystem(GameSystem):
    '''
    The StaticMemGameSystem keeps a statically allocated array of C structs as
    its components. The allocation is split out into several different 'zones'.
    This is done to help you ensure all entities of a certain type are processed
    roughly in order. The StaticMemGameSystem's components will also be pooled.
    All components will be created once and reused as often as possible.
    It will not be possibleto create more components in a zone than specified
    by the zone configuration.
    This class should not be used directly but instead inherited from to
    create your own GameSystem that makes use of the static, memory pooling
    features. This class should never be inherited from in Python as you will
    need Cython/C level access to various attributes and the components.

    **Attributes:**
        **size_of_component_block** (int): Internally the memory will be broken
        down into blocks of **size_of_component_block** kibibytes. Defaults to
        4.

        **type_size** (int): Number of bytes for the type. Typically you will
        set this with sizeof(YourCStruct).

        **component_type** (MemComponent): The object that will make your C
        structcomponent's data accessible from python. Should inherit from
        MemComponent.

        **processor** (BooleanProperty): If set to True, the system will
        allocate a helper object **ZonedAggregator** to make it easier to batch
        process all the system's components in your **update** function.
        Defaults to False.

        **system_names** (ListProperty): Names of the other component systems
        to be bound by the **ZonedAggregator**, this should be a list of other
        StaticMemGameSystem **system_id** that you will need the component data
        from during your **update** function

        **do_allocation** (BooleanProperty): Defaults to True for
        StaticMemGameSystem as we expect an allocation phase.

        **components** (IndexedMemoryZone): Instead of the simple python list,
        components are stored in the more complex IndexedMemoryZone which
        supports both direct C access to the underlying struct arrays and
        python level access to the **component_type** objects that wrap the
