msgid "One idea that is key to understanding Kivy's internals is that of modularity and abstraction. We try to abstract from basic tasks such as opening a window, displaying images and text, playing audio, getting images from a camera, spelling correction and so on. We call these *core* tasks. This makes the API both easy to use and easy to extend. Most importantly, it allows us to use -- what we call -- specific providers for the respective scenario in which your app is being run. For example, on OSX, Linux and Windows, there are different native APIs for the different core tasks. A piece of code that uses one of these specific APIs to talk to the operating system on one side and to Kivy on the other (acting as an intermediate communication layer) is what we call a *core provider*. The advantage of using specialized core providers for each platform is that we can fully leverage the functionality exposed by the operating system and act as efficiently as possible. It also gives users a choice. Furthermore, by using libraries that are shipped with any one platform, we effectively reduce the size of the Kivy distribution and make packaging easier. It's also easier to port Kivy to other platforms. The Android port did greatly benefit from this."

msgid "We follow the same concept with input handling. *An input provider* is a piece of code that adds support for a specific input device, such as Apple's trackpads, TUIO or a mouse emulator. If you need to add support for a new input device, you can simply provide a new class that reads your input data from your device and transforms them into Kivy basic events."

That would be bad because by default the background color is dark as well, so you wouldn't be able to (easily) see the lines you draw. There is a nice trick to prevent this: Instead of creating a tuple with three random values, create a tuple like this: ``(random(), 1., 1.)``. Then, when passing it to the color instruction, set the mode to HSV color space: ``Color(*c, mode='hsv')``. This way you will have a smaller number of possible colors, but the colors that you get will always be equally bright. Only the hue changes."
