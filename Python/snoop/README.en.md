Is your life slideshow? Ask Snoop.  
Snoop project is developed without taking into account the opinions of the NSA and their friends,  
that is, it is available to the average user.  

Snoop is a research dev-work (own database/closed bugbounty)  
in the search and processing of public data on the Internet.  
According to Snoop's specialized search, it is capable of competing with traditional search engines.

                       Affects the duration of the search. Affects the 'Timeout errors.'
                       It is necessary to enable this option almost always with a slow Internet connection,
                       in order to avoid prolonged freezes in case of network problems (default 9s)

                       By default, certificate verification on servers is disabled, 
                       which gives fewer errors and more positive results when searching for nickname
  --normal, -N         Change the SNOOPnina mode > normal mode.
                       On_ Silence on_ SNOOPninja mode: search acceleration ~25pct,
                       RAM saving ~50pct, repeated 'flexible' connection on failed resources
```

**Example**
```
# To search for only one user:
$ python3 snoop.py username1 #Running from source
$ snoop username1 #Running from release
# Or, for example, Cyrillic is supported:
$ python3 snoop.py –æ–ª–µ—Å—è #Running from source
# To search for a name containing a space:
$ snoop "bob dylan" #Running from release
$ snoop dob_dylan #Running from release
$ snoop bob-dylan #Running from release

# Running on Windows OS:
$ python snoop.py username1 #Running from source
$ snoop.exe username1 #Running from release
# To search for one or more users:
$ snoop.exe username1 username2 username3 username4 #Running from release

# Search for a lot of users-sorting the output of results by country;
# avoiding freezes on websites (more often the "dead zone" depends on the user's ip address);
# print only found accounts; save pages of found accounts locally; 
# specify a file with a list of wanted accounts; 
# connect to the expandable and updated web-base Snoop for search:
$ snoop -—Å -t 6 -f -S -u ~/file.txt -w start #Running from release
# check the Snoop database:
$ snoop --list all #Running from release
# print the help for Snoop functions:
$ snoop --help #Running from release

# Enable Snoop plugins:
$ snoop --module y #Running from release

# 'ctrl-c', 'ctrl-\' ‚Äî interrupt the search #it is not recommended to interrupt the search in this way in the 'SNOOPnina' mode.
$ kill $(ps aux | grep python/snoop | awk '{print $2}') #fix' for unloading RAM during interrupts.
```
The found accounts will be stored in ~/snoop/results/*/username.{txt.csv.html}.  
To access the browser to the search results on the Android platform, it is desirable to have root rights.  
open csv in office in, field separator **comma**.  

Destroy **all** search results ‚Äî delete the '~/snoop/results' directory.  
or ```snoop.exe --autoclean y #Running from release OS Windows```
```
# Update Snoop to test new features in the software
$ python3 snoop.py --update y #Git installation is required.

| ========= |=======================================================| ======= |

Solving:
1. Reconfigure your Firewall (for example, Kaspersky blocks Resources for adults).

2. Check the speed of your Internet connection:  
$ python3 snoop.py -v username  
If any of the network parameters are highlighted in red, Snoop may hang during the search.  
If the speed is low, increase the value of ' x 'of the'--time-out x ' option:  
$ python3 snoop.py -t 15 username  

3. In fact, this is not a mistake. Fix username  
(for example, some sites do not allow Cyrillic characters; "spaces"; or "Vietnamese-Chinese encoding"  
in user names, in order to save time: - requests are filtered).

4. **Change your IP address**  
("Gray" ip and censorship are the most common reasons why the user receives skip errors/false positives/and in some cases '**Alas**'.  
When using Snoop from the IP address of the mobile operator's provider, the speed **may * * drop significantly, depending on the provider.  
For example, the most effective way to solve the problem is **TO USE A VPN**, Tor is not very well suited for this task.  
Rule: one scan from one ip is not enough to get the most out of Snoop).

5. Open in the Snoop repository on Github-e Issue/Pull request  
(inform the developer about this).

6. Do not pay attention, sites sometimes go for repair work and return to operation.

7. There is [problem](https://wiki.debian.org/ContinuousIntegration/TriagingTips/openssl-1.1.1 "the problem is simple and solvable") with openssl in some GNU/Linux distributions.  
Solving:
```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

# Edit the lines at the very bottom of the file:
[MinProtocol = TLSv1.2]
on
[MinProtocol = TLSv1]

[CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2]
on
[CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1]
```
