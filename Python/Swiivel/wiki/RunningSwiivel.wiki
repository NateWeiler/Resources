= Introduction =

This page should contain a step-by-step guide for installing and running swiivel.

= Details =

Requirements:
 * python-pygame
 * python-bluez
 * N wiimotes.  Currently N should be less than 5.  If N=0, you can only play one player (with keyboard and mouse).
 * ceil(N/4) bluetooth dongles.
 * If N>0, you need a Sensor Bar.  This can be any two sources of infrared light (tea candles work well), positioned a foot or so apart in front of your screen.
 * subversion

Steps:
 * svn checkout http://swiivel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ swiivel-read-only
 * cd swiivel-read-only
 * ./swiivel.py
 * To connect a wiimote, type its bluetooth address and hit enter; on the wiimote, hold the 1 and 2 buttons to put it into discoverable mode.  If you'd rather not type the address each time, you can enter it in KNOWN_WIIMOTES under wmd/Config.py.
 * Console controls: mouse to aim, cursor keys to move, space to fire
 * Wiimote controls: point to aim, D-pad to move, A to fire
 * Escape quits the game
