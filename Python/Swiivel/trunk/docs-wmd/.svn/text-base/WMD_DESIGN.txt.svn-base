./wmd/Common.py - Loaded by most other files, contains log() and defined event names
./wmd/Config.py - Configuration file.. Need to have it pretty-print itself out in a user config file and verify if variables have changed since the last version
./wmd/Pointer.py - Everything related to IR-camera pointer control
./WMD.py - Loads the rest of WMD

WiimoteState (in Input.py) - the State indicates the current state of the Wiimote as influenced by events we cannot control: button state, battery state, accessory connection status.

WiimoteMode (in Output.py) - The Mode indicates the mode we ask the Wiimote to be in. The difference is that we choose the mode, we endure the state.
