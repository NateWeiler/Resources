#######  I. INTRODUCTION:   READ ME FIRST OR ELSE  #########
##**********************************************************
## It is important that you read this before
## trying to use WMD, or else you will fail miserably.
##
## You need technical knowledge and Linux experience
## if you are to succeed in installing WMD without help.
##
## But more than that, you need to install the following:
##
##  **  BlueZ (MUST!)
##
##  **  PyBluez 0.9.1 (MUST!)     # aka python-bluez? on ubuntu
##      http://org.csail.mit.edu/pybluez/release/pybluez-src-0.9.1.tar.gz
##
##      To use Xlib event mode   (GOOD)
##  ++  python-xlib 0.12
##  ++    with buffer overflow patch (READ SECTION: XLIB)
##
##      To use uinput event mode (GOOD)
##  ++  Linux 2.6 kernel with evdev and uinput modules
##
##      To have a GUI and accelerometer graphing (GOOD!)
##  ++  Pygame!
##
##      To have real-time graphs of the accelerometer data (disabled in 0.1.1)
##  ++  Matplotlib 0.80  // 0.87 and above seem to require a patch for now
## http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
##
##      To use the OSD (disabled in 0.1.1)
##  ++  PyOSD 0.2.14 http://repose.cx/pyosd/
##
##      To use uinput events to move the mouse (BAD!)
##      This hasn't been tested in a while...
##  ++  Xorg 7.0 with evdev
##
## 
###############
## SECTION XLIB
###############
##
##   You must used a PATCHED python-xlib 0.12 because the original
##   has a terrible bug that prevents it from starting with modern Xorg
##   python-xlib hasn't been maintained in years, but the patch is simple.
##
##   First you install python-xlib 0.12
##
##   Then you find the file protocol/display.py
#### locate protocol/display.py | grep -v pyc
##   /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/Xlib/protocol/display.py
##
##
##   Then you check if it's already patched
#### grep self.socket.recv /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/Xlib/protocol/display.py
##   recv = self.socket.recv(4096)
##
##   If the value is 4096, all is good
##   If the value is 2048, you need to edit the file and change the value to 4096
##
##   It's THAT EASY!
##
##   On Gentoo, dev-python/python-xlib-0.12-r2 is already patched.

## WOW I JUST NOTICED THAT I Can actually type while I have a wiimote. 
## I can simply losen it, and I always feel it but it doesnt disturb me.
## Except .. if I try to use the mouse. Therefore, I need a micro-LED bar
## on my monitors if I want this to be reality.
## You have the wiimote in front of your keyboard, laid out so that the 
## keys can be used as a second keyboard. You can have a wiimote stand and a
## better strap too.
## Technique: hold down with one thumb.
## It's a THUMB CONTROLLER.
## And you pick it up with two hands
## There is practice with the left hand
## You use it instead of a mouse, train with it
## With a special LED bar on your monitor, the bottom of it.

### REWRITE CONFIG TREE INTO METACONFIG TREE
### WITH META-INFORMATION IN COMMENTS


# YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS:
## If you want do use XEVDEV IO, you need to install evdev_drv for Xorg
## You also need to add this section to your xorg.conf
#
#  Section "InputDevice"
# 	Identifier	"Wiimote"
# 	Driver		"evdev"
# 	Option		"Name"		"Nintendo Wiimote"
#  EndSection
#

## You will also need to modify your ServerLayout section.
## You must have only one CorePointer, but you can have
## many AlwaysCore devices. You don't need a Synaptics
## touchpad, I just have one on my laptop.
## So this is what the beginning of my xorg.conf looks like:
#
#  Section "ServerLayout"
#  	Identifier      "X.org Configured"
#  	Screen  0       "Screen0" 		0 0
# 	InputDevice     "Mouse0"                "CorePointer"
# 	InputDevice     "Keyboard0"             "CoreKeyboard"
# 	InputDevice     "Synaptics Touchpad"    "AlwaysCore"
# 	InputDevice     "Wiimote"               "AlwaysCore"
#  EndSection
#
## Scaling is known to work badly with evdev_drv
