    "# Boosting and the AdaBoost Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **ensemble methods** can greatly improve the results achieved with weak machine learning algorithms, also called **weak learners**. Ensemble methods achieve better performance by aggregating the results of many statistically independent models. This process averages out the errors and produces a better, final, prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will work with widely used ensemble method known as **boosting**. Boosting is a meta-algorithm since the method can be applied to many types of machine learning algorithms. In summary, boosting iteratively improves the learning of the N models by giving greater weight to training cases with larger errors. The basic boosting procedure is simple and follows these steps:\n",
    "1. N learners (machine learning models) are defined.\n",
    "2. Each of i training data cases is given an initial equal weight of 1/i.\n",
    "3. The N learners are trained on the weighted training data cases.\n",
    "4. The prediction is computed based on a aggregation of the learners; averaging over the hypothesis of the N learners. \n",
    "5. Weights for the training data cases are updated based on the aggregated errors made by the learners. Cases with larger errors are given larger weights. \n",
    "6. Steps 3, 4, and 5 are repeated until a convergence criteria is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification and regression tree models** are the weak learners most commonly used with boosting. In this lab you will work with one of the most widely used and successful boosted methods, known as **AdaBoost** or **adaptive boosting**. AdaBoost uses some large number, N, tree models. The rate at which weights are updated is **adaptive** with the errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind that boosted machine learning is not robust to significant noise or outliers in the training data. The reweighting process gives greater weight to the large errors, and therefore can give undue weight to outliers and errors. In cases where data is noisy, the random forest algorithm may prove to be more robust. "
