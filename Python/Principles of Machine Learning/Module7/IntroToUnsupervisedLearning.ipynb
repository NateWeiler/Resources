    "# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will work with **unsupervised learning**. Unsupervised learning attempts to find inherent structure or relationships in complex data. Unsupervised learning does not use labeled cases in contrast with supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are number of approaches to unsupervised learning. In this lab you will work with two widely used **clustering** methods, **K-means clustering** and **hierarchical**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering separates a dataset into K clusters of equal variance. The number of clusters, K, is user defined. The basic algorithm has the following steps:\n",
    "1. A set of K centroids are randomly chosen. \n",
    "2. Clusters are formed by minimizing variance within each cluster. This metric is also know as the **within cluster sum of squares** (see further discussion in the section on evaluating clusters). This step partitions the data into clusters with minimum squared distance to the centroid of the cluster. \n",
    "3. The centroids are moved to mean of each cluster. The means of each cluster is computed and the centroid is moved to the mean. \n",
    "4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a stopping criteria is met. Typically, the algorithm terminates when the within cluster variance decreases only minimally. \n",
    "5. The above steps are repeated starting with a random start of step 1. The best set of clusters by within cluster variance and between cluster separation are retained.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since K-means clustering relies only on basic linear algebra operations, the method is massively scalable. Out-of-core K-means clustering algorithms are widely used. However, this method assumes equal variance of the clusters, a fairly restrictive assumption. In practice, this criteria is almost never true, and yet K-means clustering still produces useful results. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hierarchical clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering methods make fewer distributional assumptions when compared to K-means methods. However, K-means methods are generally more scalable, sometimes very much so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering creates clusters by either a **divisive** method or **agglomerative** method. The divisive method is a \"top down\" approach starting with the entire dataset and then finding partitions in a stepwise manner.  The later method is known as agglomerative clustering is a \"bottom up** approach. In this lab you will work with agglomerative clustering which roughly works as follows:\n",
    "1. The **linkage distances** between each of the data points is computed.\n",
    "2. Points are clustered pairwise with their nearest neighbor. \n",
    "3. Linkage distances between the clusters are computed.\n",
    "4. Clusters are combined pairwise into larger clusters.\n",
    "5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until all data points are in a single cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "The linkage function can be computed in a number of ways:\n",
    "- **Ward** linkage measures the increase in variance for the clusters being linked,\n",
    "- **Average** linkage uses the mean pairwise distance between the members of the two clusters, \n",
    "- **Complete** or **Maximal** linkage uses the maximum distance between the members of the two clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different distance metrics are used to compute linkage functions:\n",
    "- **Euclidian** or **l2** distance is the most widely used. This metric is only choice for the Ward linkage method. \n",
    "- **Manhattan** or **l1** distance is robust to outliers and has other interesting properties. \n",
    "- **Cosine** similarity, is the dot product between the location vectors divided by the magnitudes of the vectors. Notice that this metric is a measure of similarity, whereas the other two metrics are measures of difference. Similarity can be quite useful when working with data such as images or text documents. "

However, you should always keep in mind that the best model, should be selected based on the problem you are trying to solve.\n",

    "The **between cluster sum of squares** or **BCSS** is a related metric. Whereas WCSS measures how tight the clusters are BCSS is a measure of the separation between the clusters. To compute the BCSS, observe that the **total sum of squares** or **TSS** must equal the sum of the WCSS and BCSS:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab you have worked with two commonly used clustering models, K-means clustering and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. These methods are examples of unsupervised learning since they attempt to find interesting structure in data without using labels or marked cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For agglomerative cluster models the linkage can be any of:\n",
    "- **Ward** or increase in variance,\n",
    "- **Average** linkage or mean pairwise distance between the members of pairs of clusters, \n",
    "- **Complete** or **Maximal** linkage or maximum distance between the members of the two clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different distance metrics are used to compute linkage functions:\n",
    "- **Euclidian** or **l2**, \n",
    "- **Manhattan** or **l1**, \n",
    "- **Cosine** similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical problem for clustering models is to determine the number of clusters. Since there are no labels, model selection must be performed by a combination of visualization and metrics. Metrics used for evaluating cluster models include:\n",
    "- The **within cluster sum of squares (WCSS)** and **between cluster sum of squares (BCSS)** are used for K-means clustering only. Ideally a good K-menas cluster model should have small WCSS and large BCSS. \n",
    "- Most any clustering model can be evaluated using **silhouette coefficient (SC)**. The SC measures the ratio between the distances within a cluster and distances to the nearest adjacent cluster."
