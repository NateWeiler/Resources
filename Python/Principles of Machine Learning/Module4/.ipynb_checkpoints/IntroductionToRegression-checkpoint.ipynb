    "\n",
    "The method of regression is one of the oldest and most widely used analytics methods. The goal of regression is to produce a model that represents the ‘best fit’ to some observed data. Typically the model is a function describing some type of curve (lines, parabolas, etc.) that is determined by a set of parameters (e.g., slope and intercept). “Best fit” means that there is an optimal set of parameters according to an evaluation criteria we choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regression models attempt to predict the value of one variable, known as the **dependent variable**, **response variable** or **label**, using the values of other variables, known as **independent variables**, **explanatory variables** or **features**. Single regression has one label used to predict one feature. Multiple regression uses two or more feature variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical form the goal of regression is to find a function of some features $X$ which predicts the label value $y$. This function can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = f(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in regression is to **learn** the function $f(X)$ so that the predictions of $\\hat{y}$ are accurate. In other word, we train the model to minimize the difference between our predicted $\\hat{y}$ and the known label values $y$. In fact, the entire field of **supervised learning** has this goal \n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning models, including some of the latest deep learning methods, are a form of regression. There methods often suffer from the same problems, including overfitting and mathematically unstable fitting methods. \n"

To prevent this problem numeric features are scaled to the same range. \n",

A plot of residuals vs. predicted values (scores) shows if there is structure in the residuals. For an ideal regression model the variance or dispersion of the residuals should not change with the values of the predicted values. It has been said that the ideal residual plot should look like a 'fuzzy caterpillar' with no change vs. the predicted value. \n",

In other words, in any of these cases the model is not accurately computing the predicted values. \n",
