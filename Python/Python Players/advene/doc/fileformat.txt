File format
===========

The native format for storing Advene packages is XML. However, this
approach does not allow easy embedding of external resources such as
audio files, presentations, pictures, etc.

To alleviate this, a new format has been designed, inspired by the
OpenDocument format (cf www.oasis-open.org) : the native XML file,
along with its resource files, is stored in a ZIP file.

The new file extension, used to distinguish from native XML format, is
.azp (Advene Zip Package).

General layout
==============

foo.azp/
        mimetype
        content.xml
        resources/
	meta.xml (optional)
	META-INF/manifest.xml
	statistics.xml

with :
* mimetype: application/x-advene-zip-package
* content.xml: the previous package.xml format
* resources/: associated resources, available through the TALES expression /package/resources/...
* meta.xml: metadata (cf OpenDocument specification)
* META-INF/manifest.xml : Manifest (package contents)
* statistics.xml: various statistics about the package
