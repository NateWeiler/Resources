Protocol for the adhoc views
============================

The API for adhoc-views is described in
lib/advene/gui/views/viewplugin.py

Moreover, all views should inherit from AdhocView, defined in
lib/advene/gui/views/__init__.py
that provides common methods.

Parameters
==========

The format for saving adhoc-views is the following.

Mimetype: application/x-advene-adhoc-view

Content:
<adhoc id="timeline">
 <!-- Parameters -->
 <option name="" value="" />
 <argument name="" value="" />
</adhoc>

Options will directly update the self.options dictionary for each
view. Arguments will be passed, preserving their order, as .arguments
attribute of the view. Options should be generic options, independent
from the loaded package. Arguments are specific to the package data
(displayed annotation types in a timeline for instance).

Timeline:
---------

id: timeline

Arguments:
 annotation-type (id): id of an annotation type to display. May be put multiple times.
 source (tales expr.): TALES expression (applied to the package) used to get the elements to display.

Options:
 highlight (boolean)
 autoscroll (int)
 delete_transmuted (boolean)
 display_relations_type (boolean)
 display_relation_content (boolean)
