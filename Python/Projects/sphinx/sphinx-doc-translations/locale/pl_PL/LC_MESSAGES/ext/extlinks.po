msgid ""
"This extension is meant to help with the common pattern of having many "
"external links that point to URLs on one and the same site, e.g. links to "
"bug trackers, version control web interfaces, or simply subpages in other "
"websites.  It does so by providing aliases to base URLs, so that you only "
"need to give the subpage name when creating a link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/extlinks.rst:17
msgid ""
"Let's assume that you want to include many links to issues at the Sphinx "
"tracker, at :samp:`https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/{num}`.  "
"Typing this URL again and again is tedious, so you can use "
":mod:`~sphinx.ext.extlinks` to avoid repeating yourself."

msgid "The extension adds one new config value:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/extlinks.rst:26
msgid ""
"This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique "
"short alias names to a base URL and a *prefix*.  For example, to create an "
"alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/extlinks.rst:33
msgid ""
"Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  This "
"then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123. As "
"you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the base URL in "
"the place of ``%s``."

"The link *caption* depends on the second item in the tuple, the *prefix*:"

msgstr ""

"If the prefix is the empty string, the link caption is the partial URL given"
" in the role content (``123`` in this case.)"

msgid ""
"If the prefix is a non-empty string, the link caption is the partial URL, "
"prepended by the prefix -- in the above example, the link caption would be "
"``issue 123``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/extlinks.rst:47
msgid ""
"You can also use the usual \"explicit title\" syntax supported by other "
"roles that generate links, i.e. ``:issue:`this issue <123>```.  In this "
"case, the *prefix* is not relevant."

"Since links are generated from the role in the reading stage, they appear as"
