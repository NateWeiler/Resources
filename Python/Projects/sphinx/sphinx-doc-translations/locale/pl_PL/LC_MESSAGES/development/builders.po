"Builder extensions should define an entry point in the ``sphinx.builders`` "
"group. The name of the entry point needs to match your builder's "
":attr:`~.Builder.name` attribute, which is the name passed to the :option"
":`sphinx-build -b` option. The entry point value should equal the dotted "
"name of the extension module. Here is an example of how an entry point for "
"'mybuilder' can be defined in the extension's ``setup.py``"
