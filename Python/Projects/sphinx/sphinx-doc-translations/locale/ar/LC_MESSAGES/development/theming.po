"If the name of a file in the ``static/`` directory of a theme (or in the "

"For example, the *classic* theme has a file ``static/classic.css_t`` which "

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/theming.rst:279
msgid ""
"First, you may append ``_t`` to the end of any static files included with "

"Second, you may use the :meth:`Sphinx.add_js_file` method without pointing "
"it to a file. Normally, this method is used to insert a new JavaScript file "
"into your site. However, if you do *not* pass a file path, but instead pass "
"a string to the \"body\" argument, then this text will be inserted as "
"JavaScript into your site's head. This allows you to insert variables into "
"your project's JavaScript from Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/theming.rst:310
msgid ""
"For example, the following code will read in a user-configured value and "

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/theming.rst:329
msgid ""
"As a result, in your theme you can use code that depends on the presence of "
