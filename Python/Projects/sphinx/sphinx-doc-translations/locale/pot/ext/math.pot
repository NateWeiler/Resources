msgid "Since mathematical notation isn't natively supported by HTML in any way, Sphinx supports math in documentation with several extensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/math.rst:16
msgid "The basic math support is contained in :mod:`sphinx.ext.mathbase`. Other math support extensions should, if possible, reuse that support too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/math.rst:21
msgid ":mod:`.mathbase` is not meant to be added to the :confval:`extensions` config value, instead, use either :mod:`sphinx.ext.imgmath` or :mod:`sphinx.ext.mathjax` as described below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/math.rst:25
msgid "The input language for mathematics is LaTeX markup.  This is the de-facto standard for plain-text math notation and has the added advantage that no further translation is necessary when building LaTeX output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/math.rst:29
msgid "Keep in mind that when you put math markup in **Python docstrings** read by :mod:`autodoc <sphinx.ext.autodoc>`, you either have to double all backslashes, or use Python raw strings (``r\"raw\"``)."

msgid ":mod:`.mathbase` provides the following config values:"

msgid "Example: ``'Eq.{number}'`` is rendered as ``Eq.10``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/math.rst:49
msgid "If ``True``, displayed math equations are numbered across pages when :confval:`numfig` is enabled.  The :confval:`numfig_secnum_depth` setting is respected.  The :rst:role:`eq`, not :rst:role:`numref`, role must be used to reference equation numbers.  Default is ``True``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/math.rst:94
msgid "Normally, equations are not numbered.  If you want your equation to get a number, use the ``label`` option.  When given, it selects an internal label for the equation, by which it can be cross-referenced, and causes an equation number to be issued.  See :rst:role:`eq` for an example.  The numbering style depends on the output format."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/ext/math.rst:131
msgid "This extension renders math via LaTeX and dvipng_ or dvisvgm_ into PNG or SVG images. This of course means that the computer where the docs are built must have both programs available."

The default value is ``['-gamma', '1.5', '-D', '110', '-bg', 'Transparent']`` which makes the image a bit darker and larger then it is by default, and produces PNGs with a transparent background.

msgid "``dvipng`` has the ability to determine the \"depth\" of the rendered text: for example, when typesetting a fraction inline, the baseline of surrounding text should not be flush with the bottom of the image, rather the image should extend a bit below the baseline.  This is what TeX calls \"depth\".  When this is enabled, the images put into the HTML document will get a ``vertical-align`` style that correctly aligns the baselines."
