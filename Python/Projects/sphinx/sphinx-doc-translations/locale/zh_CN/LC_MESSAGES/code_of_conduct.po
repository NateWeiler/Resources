msgid ""
"Like the technical community as a whole, the Sphinx team and community is "
"made up of volunteers from all over the world. Diversity is a strength, but "
"it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we "
"have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to."
msgstr ""
"像整个技术社区一样，sphinx团队和社区由来自世界各地的志愿者组成。多样性是一种优势，但它也可能导致沟通问题和不愉快。为此，我们有一些基本规则，我们要求人们遵守。"

#: ../../sphinx/CODE_OF_CONDUCT:7
msgid "**Be friendly and patient.**"
msgstr "**友好耐心**"

#: ../../sphinx/CODE_OF_CONDUCT:9
msgid ""
"**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports "
"people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited "
"to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, "
"immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, "
"sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family "
"status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability."
msgstr ""
"**我们努力成为一个欢迎和支持各种背景和身份的人的社区。这包括但不限于任何种族、族裔、文化、民族血统、肤色、移民状况、社会经济阶层、教育程度、性别、性取向、性别认同和表达、年龄、大小、家庭状况、政治信仰、宗教信仰、身心能力。"

#: ../../sphinx/CODE_OF_CONDUCT:17
msgid ""
"**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn "
"will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users "
"and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when "
"making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might "
"not be communicating in someone else's primary language."
msgstr ""
"**善解人意。**你的工作会被别人利用，而你又会依赖别人的工作。你所做的任何决定都会影响到用户和同事，你在做决定时应该考虑到这些后果。请记住，我们是一个世界性的社区，因此您可能不会使用其他人的主要语言进行交流。"

#: ../../sphinx/CODE_OF_CONDUCT:24
msgid ""
"**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement "
"is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience "
"some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn "
"into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where "
"people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of "
"the Sphinx community should be respectful when dealing with other members as"
" well as with people outside the Sphinx community."
msgstr ""
"**互相尊重**并非所有人都会赞同这点，但不赞同并不应是不良行为和举止的借口。 我们可能时不时都有挫折感，但是我们不能让这种挫折感变成人身攻击。 "
"重要的是要记住，一个让人感到不舒服或受到威胁的社区并不是一个富有成效的社区。 Sphinx 社区的成员在与其他成员以及 Sphinx "
"社区以外的人打交道时应尊 重他人。"

msgid ""
"**Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of "

"exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited "
"to:"
msgstr ""
"**在你选择的词上要小心。**我们是一个专业的社区，我们的行为很专业。善待他人。不要侮辱或贬低其他参与者。骚扰和其他排外行为是不可接受的。这包括但不限于："

msgid ""
"**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and "
"technical, happen all the time and Sphinx is no exception. It is important "
"that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember "
"that we’re different. Different people have different perspectives on "
"issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t "
"mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming "
"each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve "
"issues and learning from mistakes."
msgstr ""
"**当我们不同意时，请尝试理解原因。**社会和技术上的分歧一直在发生，Sphinx也不例外。 我们必须建设性地解决分歧和分歧，这一点很重要。 "
"请记住，我们与众不同。 不同的人对问题有不同的看法。 无法理解为什么有人持观点并不表示他们错了。 "
"不要忘记，犯错是人类的责任，互相指责并不能使我们走到任何地方。 相反，专注于帮助解决问题和从错误中学习。"

"This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it "

"of conduct applies to all spaces of the Sphinx community."
msgstr ""
"这不是您不能做的所有事情的详尽清单。 相反，本着其意图的精神接受本指南，它是使我们所有人和我们所参与的技术社区变得更加容易的指南。 该行为准则适用于 "
