"Since reST does not have facilities to interconnect several documents, or "
"split documents into multiple output files, Sphinx uses a custom directive "
"to add relations between the single files the documentation is made of, as "
"well as tables of contents.  The ``toctree`` directive is the central "
"element."

"Simple \"inclusion\" of one file in another can be done with the "

msgid ""
"This directive inserts a \"TOC tree\" at the current location, using the "
"individual TOCs (including \"sub-TOC trees\") of the documents given in the "
"directive body.  Relative document names (not beginning with a slash) are "
"relative to the document the directive occurs in, absolute names are "
"relative to the source directory.  A numeric ``maxdepth`` option may be "
"given to indicate the depth of the tree; by default, all levels are "
"included. [#]_"

"Sphinx knows the relative order of the documents ``intro``, ``strings`` and "
