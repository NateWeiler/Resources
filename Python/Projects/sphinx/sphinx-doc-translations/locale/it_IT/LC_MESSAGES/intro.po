"This is the documentation for the Sphinx documentation builder.  Sphinx is a"
" tool that translates a set of reStructuredText_ source files into various "
"output formats, automatically producing cross-references, indices, etc.  "
"That is, if you have a directory containing a bunch of reST-formatted "
"documents (and possibly subdirectories of docs in there as well), Sphinx can"
" generate a nicely-organized arrangement of HTML files (in some other "
"directory) for easy browsing and navigation.  But from the same source, it "
"can also generate a PDF file using LaTeX."

"The focus is on hand-written documentation, rather than auto-generated API "
"docs. Though there is support for that kind of documentation as well (which "
"is intended to be freely mixed with hand-written content), if you need pure "
"API docs have a look at `Epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_, which "
"also understands reST."
