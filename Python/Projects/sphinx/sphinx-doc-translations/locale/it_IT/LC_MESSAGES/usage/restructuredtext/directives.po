"Special markup is available for displaying the productions of a formal "
"grammar. The markup is simple and does not attempt to model all aspects of "
"BNF (or any derived forms), but provides enough to allow context-free "
"grammars to be displayed in a way that causes uses of a symbol to be "
"rendered as hyperlinks to the definition of the symbol.  There is this "

"This directive is used to enclose a group of productions.  Each production "
"is given on a single line and consists of a name, separated by a colon from "
"the following definition.  If the definition spans multiple lines, each "
"continuation line must begin with a colon placed at the same column as in "
"the first line."

"However, if you have given a *productionGroup* argument you must prefix the "
"token name in the cross-reference with the group name and a colon, e.g., "
"\"``myGroup:sum``\" instead of just \"``sum``\". If the group should not be "
"shown in the title of the link either an explicit title can be given (e.g., "
"\"``myTitle <myGroup:sum>``\"), or the target can be prefixed with a tilde "
