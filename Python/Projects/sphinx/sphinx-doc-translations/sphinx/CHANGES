Release 2.0.0 (released Mar 29, 2019)
=====================================

Dependencies
------------

2.0.0b1

* LaTeX builder now depends on TeX Live 2015 or above.
* LaTeX builder (with ``'pdflatex'`` :confval:`latex_engine`) will process
  Unicode Greek letters in text (not in math mark-up) via the text font and
  will not escape them to math mark-up. See the discussion of the
  ``'fontenc'`` key of :confval:`latex_elements`; such (optional) support for
  Greek adds, for example on Ubuntu xenial, the ``texlive-lang-greek`` and (if
  default font set-up is not modified) ``cm-super(-minimal)`` as additional
  Sphinx LaTeX requirements.
* LaTeX builder with :confval:`latex_engine` set to ``'xelatex'`` or to
  ``'lualatex'`` requires (by default) the ``FreeFont`` fonts,
  which in Ubuntu xenial are provided by package ``fonts-freefont-otf``, and
  e.g. in Fedora 29 via package ``texlive-gnu-freefont``.
* requests 2.5.0 or above
* The six package is no longer a dependency
* The sphinxcontrib-websupport package is no longer a dependency
* Some packages are separated to sub packages:

  - sphinxcontrib.applehelp
  - sphinxcontrib.devhelp
  - sphinxcontrib.htmlhelp
  - sphinxcontrib.jsmath
  - sphinxcontrib.serializinghtml
  - sphinxcontrib.qthelp

Incompatible changes
--------------------

2.0.0b1

* Drop python 2.7 and 3.4 support
* Drop docutils 0.11 support
* Drop features and APIs deprecated in 1.7.x
* The default setting for :confval:`master_doc` is changed to ``'index'`` which
  has been longly used as default of sphinx-quickstart.
* LaTeX: Move message resources to ``sphinxmessage.sty``
* LaTeX: Stop using ``\captions<lang>`` macro for some labels
* LaTeX: for ``'xelatex'`` and ``'lualatex'``, use the ``FreeFont`` OpenType
  fonts as default choice (refs: #5645)
* LaTeX: ``'xelatex'`` and ``'lualatex'`` now use ``\small`` in code-blocks
  (due to ``FreeMono`` character width) like ``'pdflatex'`` already did (due
  to ``Courier`` character width).  You may need to adjust this via
  :confval:`latex_elements` ``'fvset'`` key, in case of usage of some other
  OpenType fonts (refs: #5768)
* LaTeX: Greek letters in text are not escaped to math mode mark-up, and they
  will use the text font not the math font. The ``LGR`` font encoding must be
  added to the ``'fontenc'`` key of :confval:`latex_elements` for this to work
  (only if it is needed by the document, of course).
* LaTeX: setting the :confval:`language` to ``'en'`` triggered ``Sonny`` option
  of ``fncychap``, now it is ``Bjarne`` to match case of no language specified.
  (refs: #5772)
* #5770: doctest: Follow :confval:`highlight_language` on highlighting doctest
  block.  As a result, they are highlighted as python3 by default.
* The order of argument for ``HTMLTranslator``, ``HTML5Translator`` and
  ``ManualPageTranslator`` are changed
* LaTeX: hard-coded redefinitions of ``\l@section`` and ``\l@subsection``
  formerly done during loading of ``'manual'`` docclass get executed later, at
  time of ``\sphinxtableofcontents``.  This means that custom user definitions
  from LaTeX preamble now get overwritten.  Use ``\sphinxtableofcontentshook``
  to insert custom user definitions.  See :ref:`latex-macros`.
* quickstart: Simplify generated ``conf.py``
* #4148: quickstart: some questions are removed.  They are still able to specify
  via command line options
* websupport: unbundled from sphinx core. Please use sphinxcontrib-websupport
* C++, the visibility of base classes is now always rendered as present in the
  input. That is, ``private`` is now shown, where it was ellided before.
* LaTeX: graphics inclusion of oversized images rescales to not exceed
  the text width and height, even if width and/or height option were used.
  (refs: #5956)
* epub: ``epub_title`` defaults to the :confval:`project` option
* #4550: All tables and figures without ``align`` option are displayed to center
* #4587: html: Output HTML5 by default

2.0.0b2

* texinfo: image files are copied into ``name-figure`` directory

Features added
--------------

2.0.0b1

* #1618: The search results preview of generated HTML documentation is
  reader-friendlier: instead of showing the snippets as raw reStructuredText
  markup, Sphinx now renders the corresponding HTML.  This means the Sphinx
  extension `Sphinx: pretty search results`__ is no longer necessary.  Note that
  changes to the search function of your custom or 3rd-party HTML template might
  overwrite this improvement.

  __ https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinx-pretty-searchresults

  letters in non-Cyrillic document even with ``'pdflatex'`` as
  :confval:`latex_engine` (refs: #5645)

  for general index.  Make sure your LaTeX distribution includes it.
  (refs: #5134)
* LaTeX: ``latexmk`` is required for ``make latexpdf`` on Windows

Incompatible changes
--------------------

  preferentially

  a ``conf.py`` file sphinx-build generates.
* The ``gettext_compact`` attribute is removed from ``document.settings``
  object.  Please use ``config.gettext_compact`` instead.
* The processing order on reading phase is changed.  smart_quotes, sphinx
  domains, :event:`doctree-read` event and versioning doctrees are invoked
  earlier than so far. For more details, please read a description of
  :py:meth:`.Sphinx.add_transform()`
* #4827: All ``substitution_definition`` nodes are removed from doctree on
  reading phase

* LaTeX: with lualatex or xelatex use by default :program:`xindy` as
  UTF-8 able replacement of :program:`makeindex` (refs: #5134).  After
  upgrading Sphinx, please clean latex build repertory of existing project
  before new build.
* #5163: html: hlist items are now aligned to top
* ``highlightlang`` directive is processed on resolving phase

  regarding Unicode engines xelatex and lualatex
* (added) latexmk is required for ``make latexpdf`` on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X
  (refs: #3082)

Incompatible changes
--------------------

1.6b1

* #1061, #2336, #3235: Now generation of autosummary doesn't contain imported
  members by default. Thanks to Luc Saffre.
* LaTeX ``\includegraphics`` command isn't overloaded: only
  ``\sphinxincludegraphics`` has the custom code to fit image to available width
  if oversized.
* The subclasses of ``sphinx.domains.Index`` should override ``generate()``
  method.  The default implementation raises NotImplementedError
* LaTeX positioned long tables horizontally centered, and short ones
  flushed left (no text flow around table.) The position now defaults to center
  in both cases, and it will obey Docutils 0.13 ``:align:`` option (refs #3415,
  #3377)
* option directive also allows all punctuations for the option name (refs:
  #3366)
* #3413: if :rst:dir:`literalinclude`'s ``:start-after:`` is used, make
  ``:lines:`` relative (refs #3412)

  option and other options (refs: #3416)

* :confval:`latex_keep_old_macro_names` default value has been changed from
  ``True`` to ``False``. This means that some LaTeX macros for styling are
  by default defined only with ``\sphinx..`` prefixed names. (refs: #3429)
* Footer "Continued on next page" of LaTeX longtable's now not framed (refs:
  #3497)
* #3529: The arguments of ``BuildEnvironment.__init__`` is changed
* #3082: Use latexmk for pdf (and dvi) targets (Unix-like platforms only)
* #3558: Emit warnings if footnotes and citations are not referenced.  The
  warnings can be suppressed by ``suppress_warnings``.
* latex made available (non documented) colour macros from a file distributed
  with pdftex engine for Plain TeX. This is removed in order to provide better
  support for multiple TeX engines. Only interface from ``color`` or
  ``xcolor`` packages should be used by extensions of Sphinx latex writer.
  (refs #3550)
* ``Builder.env`` is not filled at instantiation
* #3594: LaTeX: single raw directive has been considered as block level element
* #3639: If ``html_experimental_html5_writer`` is available, epub builder use it
  by default.
* ``Sphinx.add_source_parser()`` raises an error if duplicated

1.6b2

* #3345: Replace the custom smartypants code with Docutils' smart_quotes.

  By this change, output layout of every builders are changed a bit.
* The default highlight language is now Python 3.  This means that source code
  is highlighted as Python 3 (which is mostly a superset of Python 2), and no

Features added
--------------

* ``apidoc`` now ignores "_private" modules by default, and has an option ``-P``

Release 1.2 beta1 (released Mar 31, 2013)
=========================================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Removed ``sphinx.util.compat.directive_dwim()`` and
  ``sphinx.roles.xfileref_role()`` which were deprecated since version 1.0.
* PR#122: the files given in `latex_additional_files` now override TeX
  files included by Sphinx, such as ``sphinx.sty``.
* PR#124: the node generated by `versionadded`,
  `versionchanged` and `deprecated` directives now includes
  all added markup (such as "New in version X") as child nodes, and no
  additional text must be generated by writers.
* PR#99: the :rst:dir:`seealso` directive now generates admonition nodes instead
  of the custom ``seealso`` node.

Features added
--------------

* Markup

  - The :rst:dir:`toctree` directive and the ``toctree()`` template function now
    have an ``includehidden`` option that includes hidden toctree entries (bugs
    #790 and #1047).  A bug in the ``maxdepth`` option for the ``toctree()``
    template function has been fixed (bug #1046).
  - PR#99: Strip down seealso directives to normal admonitions.  This removes
    their unusual CSS classes (admonition-see-also), inconsistent LaTeX
    admonition title ("See Also" instead of "See also"), and spurious
    indentation in the text builder.

* HTML builder

  - #783: Create a link to full size image if it is scaled with width or height.
  - #1067: Improve the ordering of the JavaScript search results: matches in
    titles come before matches in full text, and object results are better
    categorized.  Also implement a pluggable search scorer.
  - #1053: The "rightsidebar" and "collapsiblesidebar" HTML theme options now
    work together.
  - Update to jQuery 1.7.1 and Underscore.js 1.3.1.

* Texinfo builder

  - An "Index" node is no longer added when there are no entries.
  - "deffn" categories are no longer capitalized if they contain capital
    letters.
  - ``desc_annotation`` nodes are now rendered.
  - ``strong`` and ``emphasis`` nodes are now formatted like
    ``literal``\s. The reason for this is because the standard Texinfo markup
    (``*strong*`` and ``_emphasis_``) resulted in confusing output due to the
    common usage of using these constructs for documenting parameter names.
  - Field lists formatting has been tweaked to better display
    "Info field lists".
  - ``system_message`` and ``problematic`` nodes are now formatted in a similar
    fashion as done by the text builder.
  - "en-dash" and "em-dash" conversion of hyphens is no longer performed in
    option directive signatures.
  - ``@ref`` is now used instead of ``@pxref`` for cross-references which
    prevents the word "see" from being added before the link (does not affect
    the Info output).
  - The ``@finalout`` command has been added for better TeX output.
  - ``transition`` nodes are now formatted using underscores ("_") instead of
    asterisks ("*").
  - The default value for the ``paragraphindent`` has been changed from 2 to 0
    meaning that paragraphs are no longer indented by default.
  - #1110: A new configuration value `texinfo_no_detailmenu` has been
    added for controlling whether a ``@detailmenu`` is added in the "Top"
    node's menu.
  - Detailed menus are no longer created except for the "Top" node.
  - Fixed an issue where duplicate domain indices would result in invalid
    output.

* LaTeX builder:

  - PR#115: Add ``'transition'`` item in `latex_elements` for
    customizing how transitions are displayed. Thanks to Jeff Klukas.
  - PR#114: The LaTeX writer now includes the "cmap" package by default. The
    ``'cmappkg'`` item in `latex_elements` can be used to control this.
    Thanks to Dmitry Shachnev.
  - The ``'fontpkg'`` item in `latex_elements` now defaults to ``''``
    when the :confval:`language` uses the Cyrillic script.  Suggested by Dmitry
    Shachnev.
  - The `latex_documents`, `texinfo_documents`, and
    `man_pages` configuration values will be set to default values based
    on the :confval:`master_doc` if not explicitly set in :file:`conf.py`.
    Previously, if these values were not set, no output would be generated by
    their respective builders.

* Internationalization:

  - Add i18n capabilities for custom templates.  For example: The Sphinx
    reference documentation in doc directory provides a ``sphinx.pot`` file with
    message strings from ``doc/_templates/*.html`` when using ``make gettext``.

  - PR#61,#703: Add support for non-ASCII filename handling.

* Other builders:

  - Added the Docutils-native XML and pseudo-XML builders.  See
    :class:`XMLBuilder` and :class:`PseudoXMLBuilder`.
  - PR#45: The linkcheck builder now checks ``#anchor``\ s for existence.
  - PR#123, #1106: Add `epub_use_index` configuration value.  If
    provided, it will be used instead of `html_use_index` for epub
    builder.
  - PR#126: Add `epub_tocscope` configuration value. The setting
    controls the generation of the epub toc. The user can now also include
    hidden toc entries.
  - PR#112: Add `epub_show_urls` configuration value.

* Extensions:

  - PR#52: ``special_members`` flag to autodoc now behaves like ``members``.
  - PR#47: Added :mod:`sphinx.ext.linkcode` extension.
  - PR#25: In inheritance diagrams, the first line of the class docstring
    is now the tooltip for the class.

* Command-line interfaces:

  - PR#75: Added ``--follow-links`` option to sphinx-apidoc.
  - #869: sphinx-build now has the option ``-T`` for printing the full
    traceback after an unhandled exception.
  - sphinx-build now supports the standard ``--help`` and ``--version`` options.
  - sphinx-build now provides more specific error messages when called with
    invalid options or arguments.
  - sphinx-build now has a verbose option ``-v`` which can be repeated for
    greater effect.  A single occurrence provides a slightly more verbose output
    than normal.  Two or more occurrences of this option provides more detailed
    output which may be useful for debugging.

* Locales:

  - PR#74: Fix some Russian translation.
  - PR#54: Added Norwegian bokmaal translation.
  - PR#35: Added Slovak translation.
  - PR#28: Added Hungarian translation.
  - #1113: Add Hebrew locale.
  - #1097: Add Basque locale.
  - #1037: Fix typos in Polish translation. Thanks to Jakub Wilk.
  - #1012: Update Estonian translation.

* Optimizations:

  - Speed up building the search index by caching the results of the word
    stemming routines.  Saves about 20 seconds when building the Python
    documentation.
  - PR#108: Add experimental support for parallel building with a new
    :option:`sphinx-build -j` option.

Documentation
-------------

* PR#88: Added the "Sphinx Developer's Guide" (:file:`doc/devguide.rst`)
  which outlines the basic development process of the Sphinx project.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* The `py:module` directive doesn't output its ``platform`` option

Release 1.0 (Jul 23, 2010)
==========================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Support for domains has been added.  A domain is a collection of
  directives and roles that all describe objects belonging together,
  e.g. elements of a programming language.  A few builtin domains are
  provided:

  - Python
  - C
  - C++
  - JavaScript
  - reStructuredText

* The old markup for defining and linking to C directives is now
  deprecated.  It will not work anymore in future versions without
  activating the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.oldcmarkup` extension; in Sphinx
  1.0, it is activated by default.

* Removed support for old dependency versions; requirements are now:

  - docutils >= 0.5
  - Jinja2   >= 2.2

* Removed deprecated elements:

  - ``exclude_dirs`` config value
  - ``sphinx.builder`` module

Features added
--------------

* General:

  - Added a "nitpicky" mode that emits warnings for all missing
    references.  It is activated by the :option:`sphinx-build -n` command-line
    switch or the :confval:`nitpicky` config value.
  - Added ``latexpdf`` target in quickstart Makefile.

* Markup:

  - The `menuselection` and `guilabel` roles now
    support ampersand accelerators.
  - New more compact doc field syntax is now recognized: ``:param type
    name: description``.
  - Added ``tab-width`` option to `literalinclude` directive.
  - Added ``titlesonly`` option to :rst:dir:`toctree` directive.
  - Added the ``prepend`` and ``append`` options to the
    `literalinclude` directive.
  - #284: All docinfo metadata is now put into the document metadata, not
    just the author.
  - The `ref` role can now also reference tables by caption.
  - The :dudir:`include` directive now supports absolute paths, which
    are interpreted as relative to the source directory.
  - In the Python domain, references like ``:func:`.name``` now look for
    matching names with any prefix if no direct match is found.

* Configuration:

  - Added `rst_prolog` config value.
  - Added `html_secnumber_suffix` config value to control
    section numbering format.
  - Added `html_compact_lists` config value to control
    docutils' compact lists feature.
  - The `html_sidebars` config value can now contain patterns
    as keys, and the values can be lists that explicitly select which
    sidebar templates should be rendered.  That means that the builtin
    sidebar contents can be included only selectively.
  - `html_static_path` can now contain single file entries.
  - The new universal config value `exclude_patterns` makes the
    old ``unused_docs``, ``exclude_trees`` and
    ``exclude_dirnames`` obsolete.
  - Added `html_output_encoding` config value.
  - Added the `latex_docclass` config value and made the
    "twoside" documentclass option overridable by "oneside".
  - Added the `trim_doctest_flags` config value, which is true
    by default.
  - Added `html_show_copyright` config value.
  - Added `latex_show_pagerefs` and `latex_show_urls`
    config values.
  - The behavior of `html_file_suffix` changed slightly: the
    empty string now means "no suffix" instead of "default suffix", use
    ``None`` for "default suffix".

* New builders:

  - Added a builder for the Epub format.
  - Added a builder for manual pages.
  - Added a single-file HTML builder.

* HTML output:

  - Inline roles now get a CSS class with their name, allowing styles to
    customize their appearance.  Domain-specific roles get two classes,
    ``domain`` and ``domain-rolename``.
  - References now get the class ``internal`` if they are internal to
    the whole project, as opposed to internal to the current page.
  - External references can be styled differently with the new
    ``externalrefs`` theme option for the default theme.
  - In the default theme, the sidebar can experimentally now be made
    collapsible using the new ``collapsiblesidebar`` theme option.
  - #129: Toctrees are now wrapped in a ``div`` tag with class
    ``toctree-wrapper`` in HTML output.
  - The :data:`toctree` callable in templates now has a ``maxdepth``
    keyword argument to control the depth of the generated tree.
  - The :data:`toctree` callable in templates now accepts a
    ``titles_only`` keyword argument.
  - Added ``htmltitle`` block in layout template.
  - In the JavaScript search, allow searching for object names including
    the module name, like ``sys.argv``.
  - Added new theme ``haiku``, inspired by the Haiku OS user guide.
  - Added new theme ``nature``.
  - Added new theme ``agogo``, created by Andi Albrecht.
  - Added new theme ``scrolls``, created by Armin Ronacher.

    theme.
  - #322: Improved responsiveness of the search page by loading the
    search index asynchronously.

* Extension API:

  - Added :event:`html-collect-pages`.
  - Added `needs_sphinx` config value and
    :meth:`~sphinx.application.Sphinx.require_sphinx` application API
    method.
  - #200: Added :meth:`~sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_stylesheet`
    application API method.

* Extensions:

  - Added the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.viewcode` extension.
  - Added the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.extlinks` extension.
  - Added support for source ordering of members in autodoc, with
    ``autodoc_member_order = 'bysource'``.
  - Added `autodoc_default_flags` config value, which can be
    used to select default flags for all autodoc directives.
  - Added a way for intersphinx to refer to named labels in other
    projects, and to specify the project you want to link to.
  - #280: Autodoc can now document instance attributes assigned in
    ``__init__`` methods.
  - Many improvements and fixes to the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.autosummary`
    extension, thanks to Pauli Virtanen.
  - #309: The :mod:`~sphinx.ext.graphviz` extension can now output SVG
    instead of PNG images, controlled by the
    `graphviz_output_format` config value.
