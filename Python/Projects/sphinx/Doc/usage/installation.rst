Overview
--------

Sphinx is written in `Python`__ and supports Python 3.5+. It builds upon the
shoulders of many third-party libraries such as `Docutils`__ and `Jinja`__,
which are installed when Sphinx is installed.

__ https://docs.python-guide.org/
__ https://docutils.sourceforge.io/
__ https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/


Linux
-----

Debian/Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install either ``python3-sphinx`` using :command:`apt-get`:

::

   $ apt-get install python3-sphinx

If it not already present, this will install Python for you.

RHEL, CentOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install ``python-sphinx`` using :command:`yum`:

::

   $ yum install python-sphinx

If it not already present, this will install Python for you.

Other distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most Linux distributions have Sphinx in their package repositories.  Usually
the package is called ``python3-sphinx``, ``python-sphinx`` or ``sphinx``.  Be
aware that there are at least two other packages with ``sphinx`` in their name:
a speech recognition toolkit (*CMU Sphinx*) and a full-text search database
(*Sphinx search*).


macOS
-----

Sphinx can be installed using `Homebrew`__, `MacPorts`__, or as part of
a Python distribution such as `Anaconda`__.

__ https://brew.sh/
__ https://www.macports.org/
__ https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos

Homebrew
~~~~~~~~

::

   $ brew install sphinx-doc

For more information, refer to the `package overview`__.

__ https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sphinx-doc

MacPorts
~~~~~~~~

Install either ``python3x-sphinx`` using :command:`port`:

::

   $ sudo port install py38-sphinx

To set up the executable paths, use the ``port select`` command:

::

   $ sudo port select --set python python38
   $ sudo port select --set sphinx py38-sphinx

For more information, refer to the `package overview`__.

__ https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=library&substr=py38-sphinx

Anaconda
~~~~~~~~

::

   $ conda install sphinx

Windows
-------

.. todo:: Could we start packaging this?

Most Windows users do not have Python installed by default, so we begin with
the installation of Python itself.  To check if you already have Python
installed, open the *Command Prompt* (:kbd:`⊞Win-r` and type :command:`cmd`).
Once the command prompt is open, type :command:`python --version` and press
Enter.  If Python is installed, you will see the version of Python printed to
the screen.  If you do not have Python installed, refer to the `Hitchhikers
Guide to Python's`__ Python on Windows installation guides. You must install
`Python 3`__.

Once Python is installed, you can install Sphinx using :command:`pip`.  Refer
to the :ref:`pip installation instructions <install-pypi>` below for more
information.

.. _install-pypi:

Installation from PyPI
----------------------

Sphinx packages are published on the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>`_.  The preferred tool for installing
packages from *PyPI* is :command:`pip`.  This tool is provided with all modern
versions of Python.

On Linux or MacOS, you should open your terminal and run the following command.

::

   $ pip install -U sphinx

On Windows, you should open *Command Prompt* (:kbd:`⊞Win-r` and type
:command:`cmd`) and run the same command.

.. code-block:: doscon

   C:\> pip install -U sphinx

After installation, type :command:`sphinx-build --version` on the command
prompt.  If everything worked fine, you will see the version number for the
Sphinx package you just installed.

Installation from *PyPI* also allows you to install the latest development
release.  You will not generally need (or want) to do this, but it can be
useful if you see a possible bug in the latest stable release.  To do this, use
the ``--pre`` flag.

::

   $ pip install -U --pre sphinx


Docker
------

Docker images for Sphinx are published on the `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_. There are two kind of images:

- `sphinxdoc/sphinx <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sphinxdoc/sphinx>`_
- `sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf>`_

Former one is used for standard usage of Sphinx, and latter one is mainly used for PDF builds using LaTeX.
Please choose one for your purpose.

.. note::

   sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf contains TeXLive packages. So the image is very large (over 2GB!).

.. hint::

   When using docker images, please use ``docker run`` command to invoke sphinx commands.  For example,
   you can use following command to create a Sphinx project::

      $ docker run --rm -v /path/to/document:/docs sphinxdoc/sphinx sphinx-quickstart

   And you can following command this to build HTML document::

      $ docker run --rm -v /path/to/document:/docs sphinxdoc/sphinx make html

For more details, please read `README file`__ of docker images.

Installation from source
------------------------

You can install Sphinx directly from a clone of the `Git repository`__.  This
can be done either by cloning the repo and installing from the local clone, on
simply installing directly via :command:`git`.

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx
   $ cd sphinx
   $ pip install .

::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx

You can also download a snapshot of the Git repo in either `tar.gz`__ or
`zip`__ format.  Once downloaded and extracted, these can be installed with
:command:`pip` as above.
