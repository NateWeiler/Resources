4.2 (2021-01-13)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Add hooks utilities to find binary dependencies of Anaconda distributions.
  (:issue:`#5213`)
* (OSX) Automatically remove the signature from the collected copy of the
  ``Python`` shared library, using ``codesign --remove-signature``. This
  accommodates both ``onedir`` and ``onefile`` builds with recent python
  versions for macOS, where invalidated signature on PyInstaller-collected
  copy of the ``Python`` library prevents the latter from being loaded.
  (:issue:`#5451`)
* (Windows) PyInstaller's console or windowed icon is now added at freeze-time
  and
  no longer built into the bootloader. Also, using ``--icon=NONE`` allows to
  not
  apply any icon, thereby making the OS to show some default icon.
  (:issue:`#4700`)
* (Windows) Enable ``longPathAware`` option in built application's manifest in
  order to support long file paths on Windows 10 v.1607 and later.
  (:issue:`#5424`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* Fix loading of plugin-type modules at run-time of the frozen application:
  If the plugin path is one character longer than sys._MEIPATH
  (e.g. "$PWD/p/plugin_1" and "$PWD/dist/main"),
  the plugin relative-imports a sub-module (of the plugin)
  and the frozen application contains a module of the same name,
  the frozen application module was imported. (:issue:`#4141`, :issue:`#4299`)
* Ensure that spec for frozen packages has ``submodule_search_locations`` set
  in order to fix compatibility  with ``importlib_resources`` 3.2.0 and later.
  (:issue:`#5396`)
* Fix: No rebuild if "noarchive" build-option changes. (:issue:`#5404`)
* (OSX) Fix the problem with ``Python`` shared library collected from
  recent python versions not being loaded due to invalidated signature.
  (:issue:`#5062`, :issue:`#5272`, :issue:`#5434`)
* (Windows) PyInstaller's default icon is no longer built into the bootloader,
  but
  added at freeze-time. Thus, when specifiying an icon, only that icon is
  contained in the executable and displayed for a shortcut. (:issue:`#870`,
  :issue:`#2995`)
* (Windows) Fix "toc is bad" error messages
  when passing a ``VSVersionInfo``
  as the ``version`` parameter to ``EXE()``
  in a ``.spec`` file. (:issue:`#5445`)
* (Windows) Fix exception when trying to read a manifest from an exe or dll.
  (:issue:`#5403`)
* (Windows) Fix the ``--runtime-tmpdir`` option by creating paths if they don't
  exist and expanding environment variables (e.g. ``%LOCALAPPDATA%``).
  (:issue:`#3301`, :issue:`#4579`, :issue:`#4720`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* (GNU/Linux) Collect ``xcbglintegrations`` and ``egldeviceintegrations``
  plugins as part of ``Qt5Gui``. (:issue:`#5349`)
* (macOS) Fix: Unable to code sign apps built with GTK (:issue:`#5435`)
* (Windows) Add a hook for ``win32ctypes.core``. (:issue:`#5250`)
* Add hook for ``scipy.spatial.transform.rotation`` to fix compatibility with
  SciPy 1.6.0. (:issue:`#5456`)
* Add hook-gi.repository.GtkosxApplication to fix TypeError with Gtk macOS
  apps. (:issue:`#5385`)
* Add hooks utilities to find binary dependencies of Anaconda distributions.
  (:issue:`#5213`)
* Fix the ``Qt5`` library availability check in ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2`` hooks
  to re-enable support for ``Qt5`` older than 5.8. (:issue:`#5425`)
* Implement ``exec_statement_rc()`` and ``exec_script_rc()`` as exit-code
  returning counterparts of ``exec_statement()`` and ``exec_script()``.
  Implement ``can_import_module()`` helper for hooks that need to query module
  availability. (:issue:`#5301`)
* Limit the impact of a failed sub-package import on the result of
  ``collect_submodules()`` to ensure that modules from all other sub-packages
  are collected. (:issue:`#5426`)
* Removed obsolete ``pygame`` hook. (:issue:`#5362`)
* Update ``keyring`` hook to collect metadata, which is required for backend
  discovery. (:issue:`#5245`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* (GNU/Linux) Reintroduce executable resolution via ``readlink()`` on
  ``/proc/self/exe`` and preserve the process name using ``prctl()`` with
  ``PR_GET_NAME`` and ``PR_SET_NAME``. (:issue:`#5232`)
* (Windows) Create temporary directories with user's SID instead of
  ``S-1-3-4``,
  to work around the lack of support for the latter in ``wine``.
  This enables ``onefile`` builds to run under ``wine`` again. (:issue:`#5216`)
* (Windows) Fix a bug in path-handling code with paths exceeding ``PATH_MAX``,
  which is caused by use of ``_snprintf`` instead of ``snprintf`` when
  building with MSC. Requires Visual Studio 2015 or later.
  Clean up the MSC codepath to address other compiler warnings.
  (:issue:`#5320`)
* (Windows) Fix building of bootloader's test suite under Windows with Visual
  Studio.
  This fixes build errors when ``cmocka`` is present in the build environment.
  (:issue:`#5318`)
* (Windows) Fix compiler warnings produced by MinGW 10.2 in order to allow
  building the bootloader without having to suppress the warnings.
  (:issue:`#5322`)
* (Windows) Fix ``windowed+debug`` bootloader variant not properly
  displaying the exception message and traceback information when the
  frozen script terminates due to uncaught exception. (:issue:`#5446`)


PyInstaller Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Avoid using UPX with DLLs that have control flow guard (CFG)
  enabled. (:issue:`#5382`)
* Avoid using ``.pyo`` module file suffix (removed since PEP-488) in
  ``noarchive`` mode. (:issue:`#5383`)
* Improve support for ``PEP-420`` namespace packages. (:issue:`#5354`)
* Strip absolute paths from ``.pyc`` modules collected in the CArchive (PKG).
  This enables build reproducibility without having to match the location of
  the build environment. (:issue:`#5380`)

  ``collect_all()``. These arguments map to the ``excludes`` and ``includes``
  arguments of ``collect_data_files``, and to the `filter` argument of
  ``collect_submodules``. (:issue:`#5113`)
* Add hook for difflib to not pull in doctests, which is only
  required when run as main programm.

  installed, not mean to be a dependency
* Add hook for zope.interface to not pull in pytest unittests, which will be
  rearly used in frozen packages.

  addition to Tcl/Tk data directories. (:issue:`#5175`)
* (GNU/Linux) {PyQt5,PySide2}.QtWebEngineWidgets: fix search for extra NSS
  libraries to prevent an error on systems where /lib64/nss/\*.so
  comes up empty. (:issue:`#5149`)
* (OSX) Avoid collecting data from system Tcl/Tk framework in ``tkinter`` hook
  as we do not collect their shared libraries, either.
  Affects only python versions that still use the system Tcl/Tk 8.5.
  (:issue:`#5217`)
* (OSX) Correctly locate the tcl/tk framework bundled with official
  python.org python builds from v.3.6.5 on. (:issue:`#5013`)

4.0 (2020-08-08)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Provide setuptools entrypoints to enable other packages to provide
  PyInstaller hooks specific to that package, along with tests for these
  hooks.

  Maintainers of Python packages requiring hooks are invited to use this new
  feature and provide up-to-date PyInstaller support along with their package.
  This is quite easy, see our `sample project`__ for more information
  (:issue:`#4232`, :issue:`#4301`, :issue:`#4582`).
  Many thanks to Bryan A. Jones for implementing the important parts.

  __ https://github.com/pyinstaller/hooksample

* A new package `pyinstaller-hooks-contrib`__ provides monthly updated hooks
  now. This package is installed automatically when installing PyInstaller,
  but can be updated independently.
  Many thanks to Legorooj for setting up the new package
  and moving the hooks there.

  __ https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-hooks-contrib

* Added the ``excludes`` and ``includes`` arguments to the hook utility
  function ``collect_data_files``.
* Change the hook collection order so that the hook-priority is command line,
  then entry-point, then PyInstaller builtins. (:issue:`#4876`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (AIX) Include python-malloc labeled libraries in search for libpython.
  (:issue:`#4738`)
* (win32) Fix Security Alerts caused by subtle implementation differences
  between posix anf windows in ``os.path.dirname()``. (:issue:`#4707`)
* (win32) Fix struct format strings for versioninfo. (:issue:`#4861`)
* (Windows) cv2: bundle the `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg*.dll`, if available.
  (:issue:`#4999`)
* (Windows) GLib: bundle the spawn helper executables for `g_spawn*` API.
  (:issue:`#5000`)
* (Windows) PySide2.QtNetwork: search for SSL DLLs in `PrefixPath` in addition
  to `BinariesPath`. (:issue:`#4998`)
* (Windows) When building with 32-bit python in onefile mode, set the
  ``requestedExecutionLevel`` manifest key every time and embed the manifest.
  (:issue:`#4992`)
* * (AIX) Fix uninitialized variable. (:issue:`#4728`, :issue:`#4734`)
* Allow building on a different drive than the source. (:issue:`#4820`)
* Consider Python<version> as possible library binary path. Fixes issue where
  python is not found if Python3 is installed via brew on OSX (:issue:`#4895`)
* Ensure shared dependencies from onefile packages can be opened in the
  bootloader.
* Ensuring repeatable builds of base_library.zip. (:issue:`#4654`)
* Fix ``FileNotFoundError`` showing up in ``utils/misc.py`` which occurs when a
  namespace was processed as an filename. (:issue:`#4034`)
* Fix multipackaging. The `MERGE` class will now have the correct relative
  paths
  between shared dependencies which can correctly be opened by the bootloader.
  (:issue:`#1527`, :issue:`#4303`)
* Fix regression when trying to avoid hard-coded paths in .spec files.
* Fix SIGTSTP signal handling to allow typing Ctrl-Z from terminal.
  (:issue:`#4244`)

  option) again. Many thanks to Matteo Bertini for finally fixing this.
  (:issue:`#2365`, :issue:`#3093`, :issue:`#3133`, :issue:`#3160`,
  :issue:`#3198`, :issue:`#3316`, :issue:`#3619`, :issue:`#4241`,
  :issue:`#4652`)
* When stripping the leading parts of paths in compiled code objects, the
  longest possible import path will now be stripped. (:issue:`#4922`)


Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  terminated"-check to use snprintf(); check succes at more places. (This
  started from fixing GCC warnings for strncpy and strncat.)
* Fix: When copying files, too much data was copied in most cases. This
  corrupted the file and inhibited using shared dependencies. (:issue:`#4303`)
