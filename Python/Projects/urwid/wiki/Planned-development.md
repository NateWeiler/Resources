NOTE: OSS development is rarely truly planned, but these are the things I have a big interest in implementing soon

[old development pages](https://excess.org/urwid/wiki/Development)

### detached_display module

* this would be awesome for debugging urwid apps
  * stdin/stdout/stderr still available on terminal where app is launched
* use unix sockets, FD passing and raw_display internals? (low level option)
* render in a new widget similar to Terminal, passing parsed keystrokes and lines of Unicode? (high level option)

### .decoration widget attribute

* points to a decoration of the widget itself, i.e. `foo.decoration.base_widget == foo`
* enables easier theming
* should simplify code in urwid apps (need to verify)
* may be generated by a property for themed widgets (this breaks simple assignment, though)
* works by inserting `foo.decoration` instead of `foo` when assigning widgets into containers or to main_loop.widget.
